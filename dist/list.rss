      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/119P4H1V0</link>
      <description>: 119P4H1V0 ( c /4 orthogonally, p4) A spaceship discovered by Dean
Hickerson in December 1989, the first spaceship of its kind to be
found. Hickerson then found a small tagalong for this spaceship
which could be attached to one side or both. These three variants of
119P4H1V0 were the only known c /4 orthogonal spaceships until July
1992 when Hartmut Holzwart discovered a larger spaceship, 163P4H1V0.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/180-degree_kickback</link>
      <description>: 180-degree kickback The only other two- glider collision besides the
standard kickback that produces a clean output glider with no
leftover ash. The 180-degree change in direction is occasionally
useful in glider synthesis, but is rarely used in signal
circuitry or in self-supporting patterns like the Caterpillar or
Centipede, because 90-degree collisions are generally much easier
to arrange.</description>

      <description>: (23,5)c/79 Herschel climber The following glider-supported
Herschel climber reaction used in the self-supporting waterbear
knightship, which can be repeated every 79 ticks, moving the
Herschel 23 cells to the right and 5 cells upward, and releasing
two gliders to the northwest and southwest. As the diagram shows,
it is possible to substitute a loaf or other still lifes for some
or all of the support gliders. This fact is used to advantage at the
front end of the waterbear.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/25P3H1V0.1</link>
      <description>: 25P3H1V0.1 ( c /3 orthogonally, p3) A spaceship discovered by Dean
Hickerson in August 1989. It was the first c /3 spaceship to be
discovered. In terms of its 25 cells, it is tied with 25P3H1V0.2 as
the smallest c /3 spaceship. Unlike 25P3H1V0.2, it has a population
of 25 in all of its phases, as well as a smaller bounding box.

Martin Grant discovered a glider synthesis for 25P3H1V0.1 on 6
January 2015.</description>

      <description>: 25P3H1V0.2 ( c /3 orthogonally, p3) A spaceship discovered by David
Bell in early 1992, with a minimum of 25 cells - the lowest number of
cells known for any c /3 spaceship. A note in
Spaceships in Conway's Life indicates that it was found with a
search that limited the number of live cells in each column, and
possibly also the maximum cross-section (4 cells in this case). See
also edge-repair spaceship for a very similar c /3 spaceship with a
minimum population of 26.

In December 2017 a collaborative effort found a 26-glider synthesis
for this spaceship.</description>

      <title>2c/3 wire - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/2c;3_wire</link>
      <description>: 2c/3 wire A wire discovered by Dean Hickerson in March 1997, using
his dr search program. It supports signals that travel through
the wire diagonally at two thirds of the speed of light.

Each 2 c /3 signal is made up of two half-signals that can be
separated from each other by an arbitrary number of ticks.
Considerable effort has been spent on finding a way to turn a 2 c /3
signal 90 or 180 degrees, since this would by one way to prove Life
to be omniperiodic. There is a known 2 c /3 converter shown under
signal elbow, which converts a standard 2 c /3 signal into a
double-length signal. This is usable in some situations, but
unfortunately it fails when its input is a double-length signal, so
it can't be used to complete a loop.
Noam Elkies discovered a glider synthesis of a reaction that can
repeatably insert a signal into the upper end of a 2 c /3 wire. See
stable pseudo-Heisenburp for details. On 11 September 2017, Martin
Grant reduced the input reaction to five gliders, or three gliders
plus a Herschel. With the Herschel option the recovery time is
152 ticks.

      <description>: 31c/240 Herschel-pair climber The mechanism defining the rate of
travel of the Centipede and shield bug spaceships. Compare
pi climber. It consists of a pair of Herschels climbing two
parallel chains of blocks. Certain spacings between the block chains
allow gliders from each Herschel to delete the extra ash objects
produced by the other Herschel. Two more gliders escape, one to each
side, leaving only an exact copy of the original block chains, but
shifted forward by 9 cells:</description>

in July 1992:

The first two gliders collide to produce a traffic light and
glider. The other two gliders react symmetrically with the evolving
traffic light to form four gliders. A glider gun can be built by
using reflectors to turn four of the output gliders so that they
repeat the reaction.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/7x9_eater</link>
      <description>: 7x9 eater A high- clearance eater5 variant that can suppress
passing gliders in tight spaces, such as on the inside corner of an
R64 Herschel conduit. Like the eater5 and sidesnagger, the 7×9
eater is able to eat gliders coming from two directions, though this
ability is not commonly used.</description>

      <title>Against the grain - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/against_the_grain</link>
      <description>: against the grain A term used for negative spaceships travelling in
zebra stripes agar, perpendicular to the stripes, and also for
against-the-grain grey ships.
Below is a sample signal, found by Hartmut Holzwart in April
2006, that travels against the grain at 2c/3. This "negative
spaceship" travels upward and will quickly reach the edge of the
finite patch of stabilized agar shown here.

Holzwart proved in 2006 that 2 c /3 is the maximum speed at which
signals can move non-destructively against the grain through zebra
stripes agar.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/AK47_reaction</link>
      <description>: AK47 reaction The following reaction (found by Rich Schroeppel and
Dave Buckingham) in which a honey farm predecessor, catalysed by an
eater and a block, reappears at another location 47 generations
later, having produced a glider and a traffic light. This was in
1990 the basis for the Dean Hickerson's construction of the first
true p94 gun, and for a very small (but pseudo) p94 glider gun
found by Paul Callahan in July 1994. (The original true p94 gun was
enormous, and has now been superseded by comparatively small
Herschel loop guns and Mike Playle's tiny AK94 gun.)</description>

from the main body of a spaceship or puffer perpendicular to the

Many known spaceships have multiple arms, usually fairly narrow.
This is an artefact of the search methods used to find such
spaceships, rather than an indication of what a "typical" spaceship
might look like.

      <title>Beehive stopper - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/beehive_stopper</link>
      <description>: beehive stopper A Spartan logic circuit discovered by Tanner
Jacobi on 12 May 2015. It converts an input glider signal into a
beehive, in such a way that the beehive can cleanly absorb a single
glider from a perpendicular glider stream. The circuit can't be
re-used until the beehive "bit" is cleared by the passage of at least
one perpendicular input.

This term has sometimes been used for the beehive catalyst
variant of SW-2, and also for Paul Callahan's larger
glider stopper, which also provides optional 0-degree and
180-degree glider outputs.</description>

      <description>: BFx59H One of the earliest and most remarkable converters,
discovered by Dave Buckingham in July 1996. In 59 generations it
transforms a B-heptomino into a clean Herschel with very good
clearance, allowing easy connections to other conduits. It forms the
final stage of many of the known composite conduits, including the
majority of the original sixteen Herschel conduits. Here a
ghost Herschel marks the output location:</description>

      <title>B-heptomino - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/B-heptomino</link>
      <description>: B-heptomino (stabilizes at time 148) This is a very common
methuselah that evolves into three blocks, two gliders and a
ship after 148 generations. Compare with Herschel, which appears
at generation 20 of the B-heptomino's evolution. B-heptominoes
acquired particular importance in 1996 due to Dave Buckingham's work
on B tracks. See in particular
My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators.

This pattern often arises with the cell at top left shifted one
space to the left, producing a seven-bit polyplet that shares the
same eight-bit descendant but is not technically a heptomino at all.
This alternate form is shown as the input for elementary
converter patterns such as BFx59H and BRx46B. This is standard
practice for elementary conduits, since many of these conduits do
in fact produce this alternate form as output.
The B-heptomino is considered a failed puffer or failed
spaceship, since on its own it travels at c /2 for only a short time
before being affected by its own trailing debris. However, it can be
stabilized into a c /2 puffer or into a clean c /2 rake or spaceship.

      <description>: bi-block puffer Any puffer whose output is bi-blocks. The term
is particularly used for p8 c /2 puffers, in which case a
bi-block fuse is created. A bi-block puffer is easily made using
two backrakes whose gliders impact symmetrically. Jason Summers
welded two backrakes to form a more compact puffer, as shown below.

By periodically burning the bi-block fuse using perturbations by a
following backrake and spaceships, c /2 rakes can be created for all
periods that are a multiple of eight.</description>

      <title>Bistable switch - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/bistable_switch</link>
      <description>: bistable switch A Spartan memory cell found by Paul Callahan in
1994. It can be in one of two states, containing either a boat or
a block. Input gliders on the appropriate paths can change the boat
to a block, or vice-versa, while also emitting an output glider.
Unlike many memory cells, attempts to change the state to the one it
is already in are ignored with the glider passing through with no
reaction. This makes it easy to reset the memory cell to a known
state. Which of the two states is considered the SET and which
considered the RESET is just a matter of convention.
The pattern below shows the "boat" state of the memory cell in its
original 1994 form. Two gliders are also shown to indicate the input
paths used to change the states. A smaller version is shown under
century eater, with the circuit in its "block" state.
As shown, the rightmost glider changes the state from a boat to a
block and emits a glider to the upper right, while the leftmost
glider passes through unchanged. Alternatively, when the state
contains a block, then the leftmost glider changes the state from a
block to a boat, and emits a glider to the lower right, while the
rightmost glider passes through unchanged.</description>

      <description>: blinker fuse A clean fuse made from a row of blinkers separated
by one cell gaps. The blinker row wick is usually created by a
blinker puffer. The fuse can burn in at least three different
ways at a speed of 2c/3 depending on the method used to ignite the
end of the row of blinkers. This variant has found the most use. The
burning advances 12 cells every 18 generations.

Fuses can also be made with blinker rows which contain occasional two
cell gaps, since the burning reaction is able to bridge those gaps.</description>

Since then many more blinker puffers have been found. The following
one was found by David Bell in 1992 when he was trying to extend an
x66 :

The importance of this larger blinker puffer (and others like it), is
that the engine which produces the blinker output is only p4. The
blinker row produced by the puffer can easily be ignited, and the
resulting blinker fuse burns cleanly with a speed of 2 c /3. When
the burning catches up to the engine, it causes a phase change in
the puffer. This fact allows p8 blinker puffers to be used to
construct rakes of all periods which are large multiples of four.</description>

      <description>: blinker ship A growing spaceship in which the wick consists of a
line of blinkers. An example by Paul Schick based on his
Schick engine is shown below. Here the front part is p12 and moves
at c /2, while the back part is p26 and moves at 6 c /13. Every 156
generations 13 blinkers are created and 12 are destroyed, so the wick
becomes one blinker longer.</description>

A universal construction elbow recipe library is also likely to
contain one or more block-pushing reactions, since blocks are

      <title>Boat-bit - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/boat-bit_(1)</link>
      <description>: boat-bit A binary digit represented by the presence of a boat next
to a snake (or other suitable object, such as an
aircraft carrier). The bit can be toggled by a glider travelling
along a certain path. A correctly timed glider on a crossing path
can detect whether the transition was from 1 to 0 (in which case the
crossing glider is deleted) or from 0 to 1 (in which case it passes
unharmed). Three gliders therefore suffice for a
non-destructive read. The mechanisms involved are shown in the
diagram below. Here the bit is shown in state 0. It is about to be
set to 1 and then switched back to 0 again. The first crossing
glider will survive, but the second will be destroyed.

In January 1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while
setting it to 0. A MWSS is fired at the boat-bit. If it is
already 0 (absent) then the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1
(present) then the boat and the MWSS are destroyed and, with the help
of an eater1, converted into a glider which travels back along
exactly the same path that is used by the gliders that toggle the
boat-bit.

There are many other equivalent methods based on alternate incoming
test signals.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/boojum_reflector</link>
      <description>: boojum reflector (p1) Dave Greene's name for the following 180-degree
glider reflector which he found in April 2001, winning $100
bounties offered by Alan Hensel and Dieter Leithner. The name is
taken from Lewis Carroll's _The Hunting of the Snark_, referring to
the fact that a small 90-degree stable reflector was really what was
wanted. 180-degree reflectors are relatively undesirable and have
limited use in larger circuitry constructions.
The boojum reflector was the smallest and fastest known stable
reflector until the discovery of the rectifier in 2009, followed by
the Snark in 2013.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/c;6_spaceship</link>
      <description>: c/6 spaceship A spaceship travelling at one sixth of the
speed of light. The first such spaceship to be discovered was the
dragon, found by Paul Tooke in April 2000. The first diagonally
moving example was the seal, found by Nicolay Beluchenko in
September 2005. Another orthogonal c /6 spaceship, found by Paul
Tooke in March 2006, is shown below. For the smallest known c /6
spaceship see 56P6H1V0.

A Caterloopillar can theoretically be configured to move at c /6,
but there are technical difficulties with speeds of the form 4 n +2,
and as of July 2018 this has not been done in practice.</description>

      <title>Catch and throw - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/catch_and_throw</link>
      <description>: catch and throw A technology used (e.g., in the Caterpillar) to
adjust the timing of a glider by turning it into a stationary object
using one interaction, and then later restoring it using a second
interaction. The interactions are caused by passing objects which
are not otherwise affected. The direction of the glider is not
usually changed.
Here is an example where a glider is turned into a boat by the
first LWSS, and is then restored by the remaining spaceships :</description>

      <title>Caterpillar - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Caterpillar_(1)</link>
      <description>: Caterpillar A spaceship that works by laying tracks at its front
end. The first example constructed was a p270 17 c /45 spaceship built
by Gabriel Nivasch in December 2004, based on work by himself, Jason
Summers and David Bell. This Caterpillar has a population of about
12 million in each generation and was put together by a computer
program that Nivasch wrote. At the time it was by far the largest
and most complex Life object ever constructed, and it is still one of
the largest in terms of population.
The 17 c /45 Caterpillar is based on the following reaction between a
pi-heptomino and a blinker :

In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45
generations, while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.
This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in
September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to
build a 17 c /45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which
pi-heptominoes crawling along two rows of blinkers interact to emit a
glider every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions
were later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic
idea of the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in
this way can be used to construct fleets of standard spaceships
which convey gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they
can be used to build more blinkers.
A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following
reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31
generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling
glider. In this case the tracks would be waves of backward-moving
gliders.

For other Caterpillar-type constructions see Centipede,
waterbear, half-baked knightship, and Caterloopillar.</description>

period doubler in some signal circuitry, for example the
linear propagator. The semi-Snark can period-double a regular
glider stream of period 51 or more, or an intermittent stream
with two gliders every 67 ticks or more, since the block reset glider
can be sent just 16 ticks before its partner.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/century_eater</link>
      <description>: century eater A 20-cell still life that functions as an eater for
the active reaction produced by any century relative. The most
well-known use is to replace a four-object constellation in Paul
Callahan's bistable switch, as shown below. In September 2014 Josh
Ball showed that a variant of this still life has a relatively
inexpensive slow glider construction recipe.

At T=256 the active reaction produces an eight-cell pattern sharing
the same grandchild as a century. The century eater at the top of
the pattern catalyzes this pattern produce a clean spark.</description>

      <title>Clearance - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/clearance</link>
      <description>: clearance In signal circuitry, the distance from an edge shooter
output lane to the last unobstructed lane adjacent to the
edge-shooter circuitry. For example, an Fx119 inserter has an
unusually high 27 hd clearance.
Also, oscillator and eater variants may be said to have better
clearance if they allow gliders or other signals to pass closer
to them than the standard variant allows. The following
high-clearance eater1 variant by Karel Suhajda allows gliders to
pass one lane closer on the southeast side, than is allowed by the
standard fishhook shape.

This is considered to be a variant of the eater1 because the
reaction's rotor is exactly the same, even though three cells in
this variant are too overpopulated to allow a birth, instead of
underpopulated as in a standard eater1 glider-eating reaction.</description>

      <title>Clock - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/clock_(1)</link>
      <description>: clock (p2) Found by Simon Norton, May 1970. This is the fifth or
sixth most common oscillator, being about as frequent as the
pentadecathlon, but much less frequent than the blinker, toad,
beacon or pulsar. It is surprisingly rare considering its small
size.

The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by
inhibiting the birth of a cell in a 3-cell corner. For example, a
clock can be used to suppress the surplus blinker produced by an
F171 conduit, significantly improving the recovery time of the
circuit:</description>

      <title>Clock insertion - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/clock_insertion</link>
      <description>: clock insertion A uniquely effective method of adding a glider to the
front edge of a salvo, by first constructing a clock, then
converting it to a glider using a one-bit spark. Here it rebuilds
a sabotaged glider in a deep pocket between other gliders:

In 2015 Chris Cain used this reaction to demonstrate conclusively
that any unidirectional glider salvo, no matter how large or
tightly packed, can be constructed by collisions between gliders that
are initially separated by any finite distance. As a corollary,
because all glider syntheses are made up of two to four
unidirectional salvos, any glider-constructible object has a
synthesis that starts with every glider at least N cells away from
every other glider (for any chosen N).</description>

      <title>Colour of a glider - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/colour_of_a_glider</link>
      <description>: colour of a glider The colour of a glider is a property of the
glider that remains constant while the glider is moving along a
straight path, but that can be changed when the glider bounces off a
reflector. It is an important consideration when building
something using reflectors.
The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First choose
some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered to be
white, and all other cells to be black or white in a checkerboard
pattern. (So the cell with coordinates ( m, n) is white if m + n is
even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of a glider is the
colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase that can be rotated
to look like this:

A reflector that does not change the colour of gliders obviously
cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than
it started on. But a 90-degree reflector that does change the colour
of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the resulting
glider will depend only on the direction of the glider, no matter how
many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility, therefore, both
types of reflector are required.
Small periodic colour-changing glider reflectors ( bouncers) are
known, and also small periodic colour-preserving glider reflectors
( bumpers). Among stable patterns, only a small colour-preserving
reflector ( Snark) is known. The smallest known 90-degree
colour-changing reflector is given at the end of the reflector
entry.</description>

      <title>Component - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/component</link>
      <description>: component A partial glider synthesis that can be used in the same
way in multiple glider recipes. A component transforms part of an
object under construction in a well-defined way, without affecting
the rest of the object. For example, this well-known component can
be used to add a hook to any object that includes a protruding
table end, converting it to a long bookend :
"Component" is also used to specify any piece of an object -
spaceship, oscillator, etc. - that can be combined with other
components in specific ways according to a grammar to produce a
variety of objects. The components can either be independent objects
that only occasionally react with each other, or else they can be
fused together to support each other. For example, any
branching spaceship is made up of several components, and there is
a single repeating component in any wicktrailer.</description>

      <title>Conduit - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/conduit</link>
      <description>: conduit Any arrangement of still lifes and/or oscillators that
moves an active object to another location, perhaps also transforming
it into a different active object at the same time, but without
leaving any permanent debris (except perhaps gliders, or other
spaceships) and without any of the still lifes or oscillators being
permanently damaged. Probably the most important conduit is the
following remarkable one (Dave Buckingham, July 1996) in which a
B-heptomino is transformed into a Herschel in 59 generations.

Several hundred elementary conduits are now known, with recent
discoveries primarily made via search programs such as CatForce
and Bellman.</description>

      <title>Converter - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/converter_(1)</link>
      <description>: converter A conduit in which the input object is not of the same
type as the output object. This term tends to be preferred when
either the input object or the output object is a spaceship.
The following diagram shows a p8 pi-heptomino -to- HWSS
converter. This was originally found by Dave Buckingham in a larger
form (using a figure-8 instead of the boat). The improvement
shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter Leithner has
since found (much larger) oscillators of periods 44, 46 and 60 that
can be used instead of the Kok's galaxy.

For another periodic converter, see the glider-to-LWSS example in
queen bee shuttle pair. However, many converters are stable.
Examples of elementary conduit converters include BFx59H,
135-degree MWSS-to-G, and 45-degree MWSS-to-G.
The earliest and simplest stable converters known are shown below.
These are an HWSS-to-loaf, MWSS-to-beehive, and LWSS-to-blinker.
These can serve as memory cells, or as the first steps in
constructing objects using salvos.</description>

      <title>Cordership - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Cordership</link>
      <description>: Cordership Any spaceship based on switch engines. These
necessarily move at a speed of c /12 diagonally with a period of 96 or
a multiple thereof. The first Cordership was constructed by Dean
Hickerson in April 1991, using 13 switch engines. He soon reduced
this to 10, and in August 1993 to 7. In July 1998 he reduced it to
6. In January 2004, Paul Tooke found the 3-engine glide symmetric
Cordership shown below.

At the end of 2017, Aidan F. Pierce discovered a clean
2-engine Cordership. There is also an adjustable-length 4-engine
Cordership found by Michael Simkin, made up of two identical or
mirror-image 2-engine components. The leading pair of switch engines
builds a block trail, which are then deleted by the trailing pair.
Corderships generate sparks which can perturb other objects in
many ways, especially gliders which can reach them from the side or
from behind. Some perturbations reflect gliders back the way they
came, and can be used for constructions such as the caber tosser
and the infinite glider hotel.</description>

      <description>: CP semi-Snark A period-multiplying colour-preserving signal
conduit found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2017, producing one
output glider for every two input gliders. It is made by replacing
one of the eaters in a Snark with a catalyst found using
Bellman. The catalyst causes the formation of a tub which
requires a second glider to delete. However, this adds 5 ticks to
the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. This is still 3 ticks faster
than the CC semi-Snark.</description>

every 11 gliders which hit it.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/demultiplexer</link>
      <description>: demultiplexer A simple Herschel circuit consisting of three
eater1s, found by Brice Due in August 2006. An input Herschel
places a boat in a location accessible to an input glider. If the
boat is present, a one-time turner reaction occurs and the glider
is turned 90 degrees onto a new lane.

If the Herschel and boat are removed from the above pattern, the
glider passes cleanly through the circuit. It can be used as the "0"
output of a one-bit memory cell, where the 90-degree output would
be the "1" output. This was the method used to store presence or
absence of neighbor metacells in the p1 megacell.</description>

      <description>: eater Any still life that has the ability to interact with certain

The eater1 is a very common eater, and the term "eater" is often
used specifically for this object. Other eaters include eater2,
eater3, eater4, and eater5, and many hundreds of others are
known. Below is a complex eater found by Dean Hickerson in 1998
using his dr search program. It takes 25 ticks to recover
after feasting on a glider:

Some common still lifes can act as eaters in some situations,
such as the block, ship, and tub. In fact the block was the
first known eater, being found capable of eating beehives from a
queen bee.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/eater1_(1)</link>
      <description>: eater1 (p1) Usually simply called an eater, and also called a
fishhook.

This eater can be constructed using a simple two-glider collision,
as shown in stamp collection. It is often modified in various
ways, or welded to other objects, to allow tighter packing of
circuits or to allow a signal stream to pass close by. See
clearance for an eater1 variant that is 1 hd shorter to the
southeast than the standard fishhook form. An eater1 can also be
used as a 90-degree one-time turner.
Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by Bill Gosper in
1971. The fishhook eater can consume a glider, a LWSS, and a
MWSS as shown below. It is not able to consume an HWSS, however.

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/eater2_(1)</link>
      <description>: eater2 (p1) This eater was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary eater1 but with two slight
differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes longer to
recover from each bite, and it can eat objects appearing at two
different positions.

The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a
glider in a position that would destroy an eater1. This novel
glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined
with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders travelling
along four adjacent glider lanes, as shown below.
The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be
useful for obtaining smaller bounding boxes. A more compact

      <title>Eater2 - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/eater2_(2)</link>
      <description>: eater2 (p1) This eater was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary eater1 but with two slight
differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes longer to
recover from each bite, and it can eat objects appearing at two
different positions.

The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a
glider in a position that would destroy an eater1. This novel
glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined
with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders travelling
along four adjacent glider lanes, as shown below.
The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be
useful for obtaining smaller bounding boxes. A more compact
variant with the same purpose can be seen under gliderless.</description>

      <description>: eater3 (p1) This large symmetric eater, found by Dave Buckingham,
has a very different eating action from the eater1 and eater2.
The loaf can take bites out things, being flipped over in the
process. The rest of the object merely flips it back again.</description>

      <description>: eater4 (p1) Another eater by Dave Buckingham, which he found in
1971, but did not recognize as an eater until 1975 or 1976. It can't
eat gliders, but it can be used for various other purposes. The
four NE-most centre cells regrow in a few generations after being
destroyed by taking a bite out of something, such as suppressing half
of a developing traffic light as it does in the
p29 pentadecathlon hassler.</description>

      <title>Eater5 - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/eater5</link>
      <description>: eater5 (p1) A compound eater that can eat gliders coming from two
different directions. Also called the tub-with-tail eater (TWIT), it
is often placed along the edges of glider lanes to suppress
unwanted gliders in conduits. Below is the standard form, a compact
form with a long hook, and an often-useful conjoined form found
with Bellman. The sidesnagger is a Spartan constellation that
has a similar glider-absorbing function, using a loaf. See also
7x9 eater.

With gliders from either direction, the eater5's eating reaction
creates a spark that can be used to reflect other gliders. See the
example pattern in duoplet, or advance any of the topmost three
gliders in the above pattern by two ticks.</description>

      <description>: edge-repair spaceship A spaceship which has an edge that possesses
no spark and yet is able to perturb things because of its ability

examples are the following two small p3 c/3 spaceships :

These were found by David Bell in 1992, but the usefulness of the
edge-repair property wasn't recognised until July 1997. The
following diagram (showing an edge-repair spaceship deleting a
Herschel) demonstrates the self-repairing action.

In October 2000, David Bell found that a T-tetromino component of a
c/4 spaceship can also be self-repairing. Stephen Silver noticed
that it could be used to delete beehives and, in November 2000, found
the smallest known c /4 spaceship with this edge-repair component - in
fact, two copies of the component:</description>

      <title>Edge shooter - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/edge_shooter</link>
      <description>: edge shooter A gun or signal circuit that fires its gliders (or
whatever) right at the edge of the pattern, so that it can be used to
fire them closely parallel to others. This is useful for
constructing complex guns. Compare glider pusher, which can in
fact be used for making edge shooters.
The following diagram shows a p46 edge shooter found by Paul
Callahan in June 1994.

Stable edge shooters became possible with the development of
Herschel circuitry. For example, NW31, BNE14T30, RNE-19T84,
and the high- clearance Fx119 inserter are often used in
shotguns for complex salvos. Composite edge-shooter circuits with
arbitrarily high clearance can be constructed.</description>

Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in May 1997. It is
composed of two elementary conduits, HFx107B + BFx59H. The F166
and Lx200 conduits are the two original dependent conduits

The F166 can be made Spartan by replacing the snake with an

      <description>: F171 An elementary conduit, the seventeenth Herschel conduit,
discovered by Brice Due in August 2006 in a search using only
eaters as catalysts. This was the first new Herschel conduit
discovery since 1998. After 171 ticks, it produces a Herschel at
(29, -17) relative to the input. A ghost Herschel in the pattern
below marks the output location:

The conduit's recovery time is 227 ticks, slower than many of the
original sixteen conduits because of the delayed destruction of a
temporary blinker, though the circuit itself is clearly Spartan.
The recovery time can be improved to 120 ticks by adding sparkers
of various periods to suppress the blinker. See clock for a
period-2 example.
The central eater in the group of three to the northwest can be
removed to release an additional glider output signal on a
transparent lane.</description>

      <title>Factory - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/factory</link>
      <description>: factory Another word for gun, but not used in the case of glider
guns. The term is also used for a pattern that repeatedly
manufactures objects other than spaceships or rakes. In this
case the new objects do not move out of the way, and therefore must
be used up in some way before the next one is made. The following
shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block factory
whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator.

This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found in
July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright in 1990, and
the block factory is Achim's p144 minus one of its stabilizing
blocks. For a block factory using stable components and triggered by
an input Herschel, see also keeper.</description>

      <title>Fast Forward Force Field - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Fast_Forward_Force_Field</link>
      <description>: Fast Forward Force Field The following reaction found by Dieter
Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the
gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow
the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6
generations.

The illusion of super-light-speed travel is caused by an LWSS that
is always created, but is then destroyed in some cases, by a signal
catching up to it from behind that necessarily never travels faster
than the speed of light. It is not possible to make any use of the
apparent super-light-speed signal. The front end of an output LWSS
can't be distinguished from the alternative dying spark output
until several more ticks have passed. Not surprisingly, this extra
time is enough to drop the average speed of information transmission
safely below c.
Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his
favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.

      <title>Filter - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/filter</link>
      <description>: filter Any oscillator used to delete some but not all of the
spaceships in a stream. An example is the blocker, which can be
positioned so as to delete every other glider in a stream of period
8 n +4, and can also do the same for LWSS streams. Other examples
are the MW emulator and T-nosed p4 (either of which can be used
to delete every other LWSS in a stream of period 4 n +2), the
fountain (which does the same for MWSS streams) and a number of
others, such as the p6 pipsquirter, the pentadecathlon and the
p72 oscillator shown under factory. Another example, a p4
oscillator deleting every other HWSS in a stream of period 4 n +2, is
shown below. (The p4 oscillator here was found, with a slightly
larger stator, by Dean Hickerson in November 1994.)</description>

      <title>Filter stream - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/filter_stream</link>
      <description>: filter stream A stream of spaceships in which there are periodic
gaps in the stream. This can thin out another crossing stream by
deleting the spaceships in the second stream except where the gaps
occur. The filter stream is not affected by the deletions so that
the same stream can thin out multiple other streams. The
Caterpillar uses filter streams of MWSSs in which there is a gap
every 6 spaceships. Here is part of a filter stream that thins a
glider stream by 2/3:</description>

      <title>Fireship - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/fireship</link>
      <description>: fireship ( c /10 orthogonally, p10) A variant of the copperhead with
a trailing component that emits several large sparks, discovered by
Simon Ekström on 20 March 2016. The interaction between the
copperhead and the additional component is minimal enough that the
extension technically fits the definition of a tagalong. However,
the extension slightly modifies two of the phases of the spaceship,
starting two ticks after the phase shown below, so it's also valid to
classify the fireship as a distinct spaceship.</description>

      <title>Fly-by deletion - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/fly-by_deletion</link>
      <description>: fly-by deletion A reaction performed by a passing convoy of
spaceships which deletes a common stationary object without harming
the convoy. Fly-by deletion is often used in the construction of
puffers and spaceships to clean up unwanted debris.
For c /2 convoys this is not usually difficult since the LWSS,
MWSS, and HWSS spaceships have such useful sparks. However,
some objects are more difficult to delete. For example, deleting a
tub appears to require an unusual p4 spaceship.

The deletion of a pond appears to require a convoy which is 89
cells in width containing a very unusual p4 spaceship which has 273
cells. There are small objects which have no known fly-by deletion
reactions. However, as in the case of reanimation, hitting them
with the output of rakes is an effective brute force method.</description>

      <description>: frothing puffer A frothing puffer (or a frothing spaceship) is a
puffer (or spaceship) whose back end appears to be unstable and
breaking apart, but which nonetheless survives. The exhaust
festers and clings to the back of the puffer/spaceship before
breaking off. The first known frothing puffers were c /2, and most
were found by slightly modifying the back ends of p2 spaceships. A
number of these have periods which are not a multiple of 4 (as with
some line puffers). Paul Tooke has also found c /3 frothing
puffers.
The following p78 c /2 frothing puffer was found by Paul Tooke in
April 2001.</description>

      <title>Fuse - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/fuse</link>
      <description>: fuse A wick burning at one end. For examples, see baker,
beacon maker, blinker ship, boat maker, cow, harvester,
lightspeed wire, pi ship, reverse fuse, superstring and
washerwoman. Useful fuses are usually clean, but see also
reburnable fuse.
A fuse can burn arbitrarily slowly, as demonstrated by the
example Blockic fuse below. A signal, alternating between
glider and MWSS form, travels up and down between two rows of
blocks in a series of one-time turner reactions. The spacing
shown here causes the fuse to burn 24 cells to the right every 240
generations, for a speed of c /10. Moving the bottom half further
from the top half by any even number of cells will slow down the
burning even further.</description>

      <description>: Fx119 An elementary conduit, one of the original sixteen

After 119 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (20, 14)

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Fx119_inserter</link>
      <description>: Fx119 inserter A Herschel-to-glider converter and edge shooter
based on an Fx119 Herschel conduit:

This edge shooter has an unusually high 27 hd clearance, one of
the highest known for a single small component. The only known
higher-clearance edge shooters are injectors making use of multiple
interacting spaceships. This makes the Fx119 inserter ideal for the
construction of wide convoys whose total width can fit within its
clearance distance.
The component creates a large cloud of smoke behind its emitted
glider which lasts for over 90 generations. In spite of this, many
tightly packed convoys can be made by injecting later gliders behind
others in the convoy, helped along by the insertion reaction which is
able to catch up to the existing gliders. The Fx119 inserter can
place a glider on the same lane as a passing glider and as close as
15 ticks behind, which is only one step away from the minimum
possible following distance.</description>

After 77 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (25, -8)

reduced slightly by suppressing the output Herschel's glider, as in
the L112 case. A pipsquirter can replace the blinker-suppressing
eater to produce an extra glider output. It is one of the simplest
known Spartan conduits, and one of the few elementary conduits in
the original set of sixteen.
In January 2016, Tanner Jacobi discovered a Spartan method of
extracting an extra glider output (top variant below). A
ghost Herschel marks the output location for each variant.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Garden_of_Eden_(1)</link>
      <description>: Garden of Eden A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only
occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with
cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was
known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because
of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a
wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been
constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This

of unknown cells by a factor of four.

Steven Eker has since found several asymmetrical Gardens of Eden
that are slightly smaller than this in terms of bounding box area.
Patterns have also been found that have only Garden of Eden

      <title>Garden of Eden - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Garden_of_Eden_(2)</link>
      <description>: Garden of Eden A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only
occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with
cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was
known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because
of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a
wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been
constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This
example was 9 × 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the
University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 × 122 example. The following
shows a 12 × 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006,

      <title>GIG - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/GIG</link>
      <description>: GIG A glider injection gate. This is a device for injecting a
glider into a glider stream. The injected glider is synthesized
from one or more incoming spaceships assisted by the presence of
the GIG. (This contrasts with some other glider injection reactions
which do not require a GIG, as in inject.) Gliders already in the
glider stream pass through the GIG without interfering with it. A
GIG usually consists of a small number of oscillators.
For example, in July 1996 Dieter Leithner found the following
reaction which allows the construction of a pseudo-period 14 glider
stream. It uses two LWSS streams, a pentadecathlon and a
volcano.

Glider injection gates are useful for building glider guns with
pseudo -periods that are of the form nd, where n is a positive
integer, and d is a proper divisor of some convenient base gun period
(such as 30 or 46), with d 13.</description>

      <description>: glider ( c /4 diagonally, p4) The smallest, most common and first
discovered spaceship. This was found by Richard Guy in 1970 while
Conway's group was attempting to track the evolution of the
R-pentomino. The name is due in part to the fact that it is
glide symmetric. (It is often stated that Conway discovered the
glider, but he himself has said it was Guy. See also the cryptic
reference ("some guy") in Winning Ways.)

The term "glider" is also occasionally (mis)used to mean "spaceship".</description>

      <description>: glider-block cycle An infinite oscillator based on the following
reaction (a variant of the rephaser). The oscillator consists of
copies of this reaction displaced 2 n spaces from one another (for

reaction to occur again halfway through the period. The period of
the resulting infinite oscillator is 8 n -20. (Alternatively, in a
cylindrical universe of width 2 n the oscillator just consists of two
gliders and two blocks.)</description>

      <title>Glider duplicator - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/glider_duplicator</link>
      <description>: glider duplicator Any reaction in which one input glider is
converted into two output gliders. This can be done by oscillators
or spaceships, or by Herschel conduits or other signal
circuitry such as the stable example shown under splitter. The
most useful glider duplicators are those with low periods.
The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple
mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input glider stream comes in
from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper
and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an
inverting reflector is required to complete the duplicator. To
produce non-parallel output, an inline inverter could be
substituted for the northmost p30 glider gun.

Spaceship convoys that can duplicate gliders are very useful
since they (along with glider turners) provide a means to clean up
many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to
impact into the exhaust to clean it up.
Glider duplicators and turners are known for backward gliders using
p2 c /2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 c /3 spaceships.
These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.</description>

      <description>: gliderless A gun is said to be gliderless if it does not use
gliders. The purist definition would insist that a glider does not
appear anywhere, even incidentally. For a long time the only known
way to construct LWSS, MWSS and HWSS guns involved gliders, and
it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner constructed the
first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).
In October 2017 Matthias Merzenich used two copies of
Tanner's p46 to create a p46 MWSS gun. This is the smallest known
gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun.</description>

a perpendicular glider stream. Two optional glider outputs are
also shown. The circuit can't be re-used until the beehive "bit" is
cleared by the passage of at least one perpendicular input. A
similar mechanism discovered more recently is shown in the

      <title>Glider synthesis - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/glider_synthesis</link>
      <description>: glider synthesis Construction of an object by means of glider
collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be
arranged so that they could come from infinity. That is, gliders
should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the
initial arrangement.
Glider syntheses for all still lifes and known oscillators with
at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham. As of June 2018,
this limit has been increased to 18 cells.
Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of
spaceships, because these can be used to create corresponding
guns and rakes. Many of the c /2 spaceships that are based on
standard spaceships have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec.
In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the
Corderships (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers
used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies
suggested that a 2 c /5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be
a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a
synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in
March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform
the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build
a c /2 forward rake for the 2 c /5 spaceship; this was the first example
in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same
direction as the rake but more slowly.
A 3-glider synthesis of a pentadecathlon is shown in the diagram
below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a
surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three
gliders would already be known.</description>

      <description>: glider turner Any reaction in which a glider is turned onto a new
path by a spaceship, oscillator, or still life constellation.
In the last two cases, the glider turner is usually called a
reflector if the reaction is repeatable, or a one-time turner
if the reaction can only happen once.
Glider turners are easily built using standard spaceships. The
following diagram shows a convoy which turns a forward glider 90
degrees, with the new glider also moving forwards.

Small rearrangements of the back two spaceships can alternatively
send the output glider into any of the other three directions.

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Heisenburp_device</link>
      <description>: Heisenburp device A pattern which can detect the passage of a
glider without affecting the glider's path or timing. The first
such device was constructed by David Bell in December 1992. The
term, coined by Bill Gosper, refers to the fact that Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle fails to apply in the Life universe. See also
stable pseudo-Heisenburp and natural Heisenburp.
The following is an example of the kind of reaction used at the
heart of a Heisenburp device. The glider at bottom right alters the
reaction of the other two gliders without itself being affected in
any way.</description>

      <title>Herschel - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Herschel</link>
      <description>: Herschel (stabilizes at time 128) The following pattern which occurs
at generation 20 of the B-heptomino.

The name is commonly ascribed to the Herschel heptomino's
similarity to a planetary symbol. William Herschel discovered Uranus
in 1781. However, in point of fact a Herschel bears no particular
resemblance to either of the symbols used for Uranus, but does
closely resemble the symbol for Saturn. So the appropriate name might
actually be "Huygens", but "Herschel" is now universally used by
tradition.
Herschels are one of the most versatile types of signal in stable
circuitry. R-pentominoes and B-heptominoes naturally evolve into
Herschels, and converters have also been found that change
pi-heptominoes and several other signal types into Herschels, and
vice versa. See elementary conduit.</description>

      <title>Herschel great-grandparent - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Herschel_great-grandparent</link>
      <description>: Herschel great-grandparent A specific three- tick predecessor of a
Herschel, commonly seen in Herschel conduit collections that
contain dependent conduits. In some situations it is helpful to
display the input reaction in this form instead of the standard
Herschel form.

Dependent conduit inputs are catalysed by a transparent block
before the Herschel's standard form can appear, and before the
Herschel's first natural glider is produced. This means that these
conduits will fail if an actual Herschel is placed in the "correct"
input location for a dependent conduit. Refer to F166 or Lx200
to see the correct relative placement of the standard transparent
block catalyst.
Almost all known Herschel conduits produce a Herschel
great-grandparent near the end of their evolutionary sequence. In
the original universal set of Herschel conduits, Fx158 is the
only exception.</description>

      <title>Herschel receiver - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Herschel_receiver</link>
      <description>: Herschel receiver Any circuit that converts a tandem glider into
a Herschel signal. The following diagram shows a pattern found
by Paul Callahan in 1996, as part of the first stable glider
reflector. Used as a receiver, it converts two parallel input
gliders (with path separations of 2, 5, or 6) to an R-pentomino.
The signal is then converted to a Herschel by one of several known
mechanisms, the first of which was found by Dave Buckingham way back
in 1972. The second is elementary conduit RF48H, found by
Stephen Silver in October 1997. The receiver version shown below
uses Buckingham's R-to-Herschel converter, which is made up of
elementary conduit RF28B followed by BFx59H.</description>

      <title>Herschel stopper - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Herschel_stopper</link>
      <description>: Herschel stopper A method of cleanly suppressing a Herschel signal
with an asynchronous boat-bit, discovered by Dean Hickerson.
Here a ghost Herschel marks the location of the output signal, in
cases where the boat-bit is not present. Other boat-bit locations
that allow for clean suppression of a Herschel are also known.

This term is also sometimes used to refer to any mechanism that
cleanly suppresses a Herschel. These usually allow the Herschel's
first natural glider to escape, so they are more commonly
classified as converters. See SW-2.</description>

      <title>Herschel transmitter - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Herschel_transmitter</link>
      <description>: Herschel transmitter Any Herschel -to-two- glider converter that
produces a tandem glider that can be used as input to a
Herschel receiver. If the gliders are far enough apart, and if one
of the gliders is used only for cleanup, then the transmitter is
ambidextrous : with a small modification to the receiver, a
suitably oriented mirror image of the receiver will also work.
The following diagram shows a stable Herschel transmitter found
by Paul Callahan in May 1997:

Examples of small reversible p6 and p7 transmitters are also known,
and more recently several alternate Herschel transceivers have been
found with different lane spacing, e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, and 13.</description>

      <title>Highway robber - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/highway_robber</link>
      <description>: highway robber Any mechanism that can retrieve a signal from a
spaceship lane while allowing spaceships on nearby lanes to pass by
unaffected. In practice the spaceship is generally a glider. The
signal is removed from the lane, an output signal is generated
elsewhere, and the highway robber returns to its original state. A
competent highway robber does not affect gliders even on the lane
adjacent to the affected glider stream, except during its recovery
period.
A perfect highway robber doesn't affect later gliders even in the
lane to which it is attached, even during its recovery period. Below
is a near-perfect highway robber "bait" that requires three
synchronized signals to rebuild (the Herschel, B-heptomino, and
glider.) The glider at the top right passes by unharmed, but
another glider following on the same lane 200 ticks later will be
cleanly reflected to a new path, and another glider following that
one will also pass by unharmed. The only imperfection is a few ticks
at the very end of the reconstruction, as the beehive is being
rebuilt:</description>

      <title>Honey bit - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/honey_bit_(1)</link>
      <description>: honey bit A block and pond constellation used in the
OTCA metapixel by Brice Due in 2006, to store and retrieve a bit of
data - specifically, the presence or absence of a neighbor
metacell. The "0" state of the honey bit memory unit is a simple
beehive, which is also the source of the name.
An input glider collides with the beehive to convert it into the
honey bit constellation, which can be thought of as a value of "1"
stored in the memory unit. A passing LWSS can then test for the
presence of the pond. If a collision occurs, the LWSS and the honey
bit constellation are mutually annihilated, leaving just the original
beehive. Below is the honeybit constellation with the two reactions
occurring in the opposite order - test, then reset.

If the pond is not present, the LWSS passes by the beehive without
affecting it. Thus a test input has an output for the "0" case, but
not for the "1" case. For an alternative memory-unit mechanism with
both "0" and "1" outputs, see demultiplexer.
The honey bit is also an interesting eater for the HWSS as
shown below. An HWSS colliding with the pond happens to create the
exact same reset glider used in the above memory unit.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/H-to-MWSS</link>
      <description>: H-to-MWSS A Spartan converter found by Tanner Jacobi in October
2015, which converts an input Herschel to a middleweight spaceship.
The key discovery was a very small but slightly dirty H-to-MWSS
conduit, where a Herschel is catalyzed to produce an MWSS but also
leaves behind a beehive. Prefixing two R64 conduits to this
produces a composite converter that successfully deletes the
beehive in advance, using the input Herschel's
first natural glider.

There are many other ways to remove the beehive using a spare glider
or additional conduits, but they are generally less compact than
this.</description>

      <title>Infinite growth - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/infinite_growth_(1)</link>
      <description>: infinite growth Growth of a finite pattern such that the population
tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is
used for growth of something other than population (for example,
length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth.
The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the
Gosper glider gun, created in a response to a $50 prize challenge
by John Conway. Martin Gardner's October 1970 article described the
challenge as "Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without
limit", but Conway later explained that he had always expected that
this would be disproved. The original purpose in investigating CA
rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule
could support a universal computer and/or universal constructor.
If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of
these would be possible.
An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a
pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman
found that a switch engine could be stabilized by a pre-block in
a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite
growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until
Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with
infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below,
which is much neater, being a single cluster. This produces a
stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.

Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan showed in October 1997 that there is no
infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that question
has now been answered.
In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision
that produces a glider-producing stabilized switch engine and thus
produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders
(since all 71 2-glider collisions have a finite limit population).
Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by
Callahan), which is the only 5×5 pattern with infinite growth. This
too emits a block-laying switch engine.

Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in
May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This
pattern was very large (12470×1 in the first version, reduced to
5447×1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an
exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39×1 pattern
shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines,
stability being achieved at generation 1483.

Larger patterns have since been constructed that display
quadratic growth.
Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that
is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are
possible, quadratic growth (see also breeder) being the fastest.
Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates,
such as sawtooths and a caber tosser. Another pattern with
superlinear but non-quadratic growth is Gotts dots.

      <title>Inject - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/inject</link>
      <description>: inject A reaction in which a hole in a regular spaceship stream is
filled partially or fully by adding a new spaceship of the same type
without affecting the existing spaceships in the stream. Depending
on the period of the stream, different mechanisms can be used. For
adding a spaceship to an existing multi-lane convoy, see
inserter.
For large period glider streams, simple reactions such as
LWSS-LWSS bounce and LWSS-glider bounce suffice. If Herschel
technology is used, a large number of edge shooters and
transparent conduits are known. Simple examples include the NW31
Herschel-to-glider converter and the Fx119 inserter.
Shown below is an injector found by Dave Buckingham that can fill a
hole in a p15 glider stream:

For very low-period glider streams, a GIG is a much more efficient
insertion method, in the sense that fewer synchronized signals
are needed. However, it has been shown that colliding gliders can
complete an insertion even into a single-glider gap in a period-14
stream.</description>

      <title>Keeper - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/keeper</link>
      <description>: keeper A type of factory circuit that always results in the
presence of an object in the output location, whether or not the
object was previously present. In many cases it is easy to construct
examples by connecting multiple circuits to shoot down an object with
a glider, then rebuild the object again later. The smallest keeper
circuits accomplish the same thing more directly with a lucky
preliminary spark from the active reaction, which removes the
existing object (if any) just before the construction occurs. Below
is a useful block keeper with a Herschel input.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/kickback_reaction</link>
      <description>: kickback reaction The following collision of two gliders whose
product is a single glider travelling in the opposite direction to
one of the original gliders. This is important in the proof of the
existence of a universal constructor, and in Bill Gosper's
total aperiodic, as well as a number of other constructions.

      <description>: L112 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen
Herschel conduits, discovered by Dave Buckingham in July 1996. It
is made up of two elementary conduits, HLx53B + BFx59H. After
112 ticks, it produces a Herschel turned 90 degrees
counterclockwise at (12, -33) relative to the input. Its
recovery time is 61 ticks; this can be reduced slightly by removing
the output glider, either with a specialized eater (as in the
original true p59 gun), or with a sparker as in most of the
Quetzal guns. It can be made Spartan by replacing the
aircraft carrier with an eater1. A ghost Herschel in the

      <title>Lightspeed bubble - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/lightspeed_bubble_(1)</link>
      <description>: lightspeed bubble A type of negative spaceship travelling through
the zebra stripes agar. The center of the bubble is simple empty
space, and the length and/or width of the bubble can usually be
extended to any desired size.
Below is a small stabilized section of agar containing a sample
lightspeed bubble, found by Gabriel Nivasch in August 1999. The
bubble travels to the left at the speed of light, so it will
eventually reach the edge of any finite patch and destroy itself and
its supporting agar.

An open problem related to lightspeed bubbles was whether large
extensible empty areas could be created whose length was not
proportional to the width (as it must be in the above case, due to
the tapering back edge). This was solved in February 2017 by Arie
Paap; a simple period-2 solution is shown below.</description>

      <title>Lightspeed wire - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/lightspeed_wire_(1)</link>
      <description>: lightspeed wire Any wick that can burn non-destructively at the
speed of light. Lightspeed wires are a type of reburnable fuse.
These are potentially useful for various things, but so far the
necessary mechanisms are very large and unwieldy. In October 2002,
Jason Summers discovered a lightspeed reaction travelling through an
orthogonal chain of beehives. Summers completed a period-1440
lightspeed telegraph based on this reaction in 2003.

A stable lightspeed transceiver mechanism using this same
signal reaction, the p1 telegraph, was constructed by Adam P.
Goucher in 2010; the bounding boxes of both the transmitter and
receiver are over 5000 cells on a side. A more compact periodic
high-bandwidth telegraph with a much improved transmission rate was
completed by Louis-François Handfield in 2017.
The following diagram shows an older example of a lightspeed wire,
with a small defect that travels along it at the speed of light. As
of June 2018, no method has been found of creating such a defect in
the upstream end of this particular stable wire, or of
non-destructively detecting the arrival of the defect and repairing
the wire at the downstream end.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/line-mending_reaction</link>
      <description>: line-mending reaction A reaction which can fully mend a sealed gap in
an infinite diagonal line of cells, such as the one produced by a
line-cutting reaction. Such a reaction is demonstrated below. See
the line cutting reaction for a way of creating the gliders
travelling parallel to the line.

This reaction uses spaceships on both sides of the line which need
to be synchronized to each other, for example by passing a glider
through the gap to trigger the creation of the required spaceships
and gliders.
No simple mechanism is known to mend the gap which lies completely
on one side of the line. However, it is technically possible to use
construction arm technology to push objects through the gap to
build and trigger a seed for the required synchronized signals
on the other side.</description>

      <title>LWSS - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/LWSS_(1)</link>
      <description>: LWSS ( c /2 orthogonally, p4) A lightweight spaceship, the smallest
known orthogonally moving spaceship, and the second most common
(after the glider). Found by Conway when one formed from a random
soup in 1970. See also MWSS and HWSS.

The LWSS possesses a tail spark which can easily perturb other
objects which grow into its path. The spaceship can also perturb
some objects in additional ways. For examples, see blinker ship,
hivenudger, and puffer train.
Dave Buckingham found that the LWSS can be synthesized in several
different ways using three gliders, and can be constructed from two
gliders and another small object in several more ways. Here is the
fastest synthesis :</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Lx200</link>
      <description>: Lx200 A composite conduit, one of the original sixteen
Herschel conduits, discovered by Paul Callahan in June 1997. It is
made up of two elementary conduits, HL141B + BFx59H. The Lx200
and F166 conduits are the two original dependent conduits
(several more have since been discovered.) After 200 ticks, it
produces an inverted Herschel turned 90 degrees counterclockwise at
(17, -40) relative to the input. Its recovery time is 90 ticks.
It can be made Spartan by replacing the snakes with eater1s in
one of two orientations. A ghost Herschel in the pattern below
marks the output location:

The input shown here is a Herschel great-grandparent, since the
input reaction is catalysed by the transparent block before the
Herschel's standard form can appear.</description>

      <title>Memory cell - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/memory_cell</link>
      <description>: memory cell A type of information storage circuit useful in many
patterns that perform complex logical operations. Most commonly a
memory cell can store a single bit of information. See for example
demultiplexer, honey bit, and boat-bit. Depending on the
application, the circuit may be a toggle circuit or a
permanent switch, or it may be possible to send one or more signals
to set the circuit to a "1" state, as can be done with a keeper
mechanism. In that case a different input signal must be used to
test the current state, usually with a destructive read reaction.
A more complicated example can be found in the Osqrtlogt pattern,
which destructively reads a growing 2-dimensional array of minimal
memory cells. Each memory cell may either contain a boat (below
left) or empty space (below right), with no permanent circuitry
anywhere near:

The two beehives and the block are placed by slow salvos, after
an initial 90-degree 2-glider collision that produces a target
honey farm. The beehive constellation acts as a one-time
turner for an incoming glider. If the boat is present, it acts
as a second one-time turner for that glider, sending back a "1"
signal. The "backstop" block in the northeast is destroyed cleanly
in either the "0" or the "1" case.</description>

Compare with jam. In terms of its minimum population of 12 it
ties with mazing as the smallest p4 oscillator. But in terms of
its 6×6 bounding box it wins outright. In fact, of all oscillators
that fit in a 6×7 box it is the only one with period greater than

The MWSS possesses both a tail spark and a belly spark which
can easily perturb other objects as it passes by. The spaceship can
also perturb some objects in additional ways. For examples see
blinker puffer and glider turner.
Dave Buckingham found that the MWSS can be synthesized using three
gliders, and can be constructed from two gliders and another small
object in several more ways. Here is the glider synthesis :</description>

      <description>: MWSS out of the blue The following reaction, found by Peter Rott in
November 1997, in which a LWSS passing by a p46 oscillator
creates a MWSS travelling in the opposite direction. Together with
some reactions found by Dieter Leithner, and an LWSS-turning reaction
which Rott had found in November 1993 (but which was not widely known
until Paul Callahan rediscovered it in June 1994) this can be used to
prove that there exist gliderless guns for LWSS, MWSS and HWSS
for every period that is a multiple of 46.</description>

      <title>Negative spaceship - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/negative_spaceship</link>
      <description>: negative spaceship A type of signal travelling through a periodic
agar such as zebra stripes. The leading edge of the signal
removes the agar, and the trailing edge rebuilds the agar some time
later. The distance between the two edges is sometimes adjustable,
as shown in lightspeed bubble. The central part of the "spaceship"
may consist of dying sparks or even simple empty space.
Below is a sample period-5 negative spaceship, found by Hartmut
Holzwart in March 2007, in a small stabilized section of
zebra stripes agar:

The "spaceship" travels to the left at the speed of light, so it
will eventually reach the edge of any finite patch and destroy itself
and its supporting agar.</description>

      <description>: nonomino switch engine predecessor This is the unique nonomino (a
polyomino having 9 cells) whose evolution results in a
switch engine, and the smallest polyomino to do so.

Charles Corderman may have found this object in 1971 while
exhaustively investigating the fate of all the small polyominoes.
Records indicate that he found the switch engine while
investigating the decominoes (polyominoes having 10 cells). However,
there do not appear to be decominoes which result in a clean
switch engine. If Corderman was examining polyominoes in order of
size, then this smaller predecessor should have been found first in
any case.</description>

      <title>NW31 - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/NW31</link>
      <description>: NW31 One of the most common stable edge shooters. This
Herschel-to-glider converter suppresses the junk ordinarily left
behind by an evolving Herschel while allowing both the
first natural glider and second natural glider to escape on
transparent lanes :

The edge shooter output at the top has no additional clearance, so
its use in creating convoys is limited: it can only add gliders on
the outermost lanes of an existing glider salvo. Like the beehive
version of SW-2, either output can be used to build logical OR
gates, where multiple input signal paths are merged onto the same
output path.
The complete name for this converter is "NW31T120", where 31 is the
output glider lane number. In the above orientation, lane numbers
get bigger toward the upper right and smaller toward the lower left
(and may easily be negative).
The T120 timing measurement means that a canonical NW glider placed
on lane 31 at time T=120, at (+31, +0) relative to the input
Herschel, would in theory reach the exact same spacetime locations as
the converter's output glider does.
Most converters are not edge shooters and their output lanes are
not transparent, so they usually have catalysts that would interfere
with this theoretically equivalent glider. This is the case for the
optional third glider output created by the lower eater1 catalyst:
the upper eater1 overlaps its lane. For the alternate block
catalyst suppressing this glider output, see transparent lane.</description>

      <title>P11 bumper - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/p11_bumper</link>
      <description>: p11 bumper (p11) A periodic colour-preserving glider reflector
with a minimum repeat time of 44 ticks. Unlike the p5 through p8
cases where Noam Elkies' domino -spark based reflectors are
available, no small period-22 colour-changing reflector is known.
A stable Snark reflector can be substituted for any bumper.
This changes the timing of the output glider, which can be useful for
rephasing periodic glider streams.

In practice this reflector is not useful with input streams below
period 121, because lower-period bumpers can be used to reflect all
smaller multiples of 11 for which the bumper reaction can be made to
work.</description>

      <description>: p130 shuttle A shuttle found in March 2004 by David Eppstein, which
originally needed several period 5 oscillators for support. David
Bell found a reaction between two of the shuttles to produce a p130
glider gun. On 18 November 2017 Tanner Jacobi found that the
stable sidesnagger can be used to support the shuttle instead,
and this is shown here.</description>

      <description>: p256 gun A true period 256 four-barrelled glider gun found by
Dave Buckingham in September 1995. It uses four R64 conduits to
make the second smallest known Herschel loop (after the
Simkin glider gun). The p256 gun was an early "teaser" from Dave
Buckingham before he released his full Herschel technology.

Either eaters or snakes can be added as shown above, to suppress
three of the glider streams so that only one stream escapes. This
gun's p256 glider stream is well-suited for repeated reactions with
receding Corderships, or for "Hashlife-friendly" signal
circuitry.</description>

by Bill Gosper in November 1970 (see Gosper glider gun), was also
the first gun found of any period. All known p30 glider guns are
made from two or more interacting queen bee shuttles. Paul Callahan
found 30 different ways that three queen bee shuttles can react to
form a period 30 glider gun. One of the most interesting of these is

somewhat larger form. This was the smallest known gliderless gun and
smallest known MWSS gun until the construction in 2017 of the gun
shown under gliderless, based on Tanner's p46.
The p44 MWSS gun is based on a p44 oscillator discovered by Dave
Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in
January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 sparker by Nicolay
Beluchenko. A glider shape appears in this gun for three consecutive
generations, but always as part of a larger cluster, so even a
purist would regard this gun as gliderless.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/p46_gun</link>
      <description>: p46 gun A glider gun which has true-period 46. The first one found
was the new gun by Bill Gosper in 1971. Prior to the discovery of
Tanner's p46 in October 2017, all known p46 guns were made from two
or more twin bees shuttles that interact (e.g., see
twin bees shuttle pair). See edge shooter and double-barrelled
for two more of these.
On 21 October 2017 Heinrich Koenig found a glider gun using two
copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other. This
is the first p46 gun found which makes no use of the
twin bees shuttle.

See gliderless for a MWSS gun also made using two copies of
Tanner's p46.</description>

Unlike the various bouncers discovered many years earlier, it is a

year by the discovery of the much smaller stable Snark, which uses
the same initial bait reaction and so produces an output glider
with the same timing. For a smaller periodic colour-preserving
glider reflector with a different output timing, see p4 bumper.</description>

      <description>: p92 gun A glider gun with a true period of 92. The first one was
found by Bill Gosper in 1971 using a period doubling reaction using
two p46 guns. Many different p92 guns are known that use multiple
twin bees shuttles. A period 92 gun can also be made by adding a
semi-cenark to any period 46 glider gun.
On 18 November 2017, Martin Grant found a new gun using one twin
bees shuttle and one Tanner's p46 oscillator, making it the
smallest known p92 gun.</description>

or puffer, that damages or modifies the standard output. Compare
tagalong. In 2009, while experimenting with novelty generator
patterns in Golly, Mitchell Riley discovered parasites on glider
streams from p20 and p8 backward rakes. In some cases, parasites can
even "reproduce", as in the pattern below, though the number of
copies is limited since they will eventually use up their host glider
stream:</description>

      <title>Partial result - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/partial_result</link>
      <description>: partial result An intermediate object found by a search program
which might be a substantial part of a complete spaceship or
oscillator, but which isn't complete.
Running a partial result works for a few generations until the
speed of light corruption from any unfinished edge destroys the
whole object. But a partial result can still be used to see whether
the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired spark or
perturbation. If no partial results are found then it is likely
that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.
Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance
that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is
no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a
base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search
area, or splitting the object into multiple arms might result in
finding a complete working object.
As an example, here is a large partial result for a period 6
knightship found by Josh Ball in April 2017. The first 22 columns
were rediscovered in 2018 as part of the successful search for
Sir Robin. See also almost knightship for an earlier small
example by Eugene Langvagen.</description>

      <title>Pentadecathlon - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pentadecathlon</link>
      <description>: pentadecathlon (p15) Found in 1970 by Conway while tracking the
history of short rows of cells, 10 cells giving this object, which is
the most natural oscillator of period greater than 3. In fact it
is the fifth most common oscillator overall, appearing in random
soups slightly more frequently than the clock, but much less
frequently than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar. The
pentadecathlon can be constructed using just three gliders, as shown
in glider synthesis.

The pentadecathlon is the only known oscillator that has two
phases that are different polyominoes. It produces accessible
V sparks and domino sparks, which give it a great capacity for
doing perturbations, especially for period 30 based technology.
See relay for example.</description>

      <title>Period multiplier - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/period_multiplier</link>
      <description>: period multiplier A term commonly used for a pulse divider, because
dividing the number of signals in a regular stream by N necessarily
multiplies the period by N. The term "period multiplier" can be
somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can
accept input streams that are not strictly periodic.
Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple
the output of some rakes to create high-period rakes in a
relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a
linear increase in size).
For Herschel signals and glider guns, a number of small period
doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example,
the following conduit produces one output glider after accepting
four input B-heptominoes, or four Herschels if a conduit such as
F117 is prepended that includes the same BFx59H converter.

See semi-Snark and tremi-Snark for additional examples using
glider streams. As of June 2018 no stable period-multiplying
elementary conduits are known for a multiplication factor of five
or higher, though it is easy to construct composite ones.</description>

      <title>Permanent switch - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/permanent_switch</link>
      <description>: permanent switch A signal -carrying circuit that can be modified
so that it cleanly absorbs any future signals instead of allowing
them to pass. Optionally there may be a separate mechanism to
restore the circuit to its original function.
In the following example, a glider from the northeast (shown) will
perform a simple block pull that switches off an F166 conduit, so
that any future Herschel inputs will be cleanly absorbed. A glider
from the southwest (also shown) can restore the block to its original
position.</description>

      <title>Phase change - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/phase_change_(1)</link>
      <description>: phase change A perturbation of a periodic object that causes the
object to skip forward or backward by one or more phases. If the
perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change
the period of the object. An example of this, found by Dean
Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the
period of the oscillator would be 7 if the mold were removed, but
the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes
caused by the mold's spark.

The following pattern demonstrates a p4 c /2 spaceship found by
Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a
forward glider. This phase change allows the spaceship to be used
to delete a glider wave produced by a rake whose period is 2 (mod
4).

Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of
spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow
the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling convoys to
easily produce very high period rakes.

      <title>Phoenix - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/phoenix_(1)</link>
      <description>: phoenix Any pattern all of whose cells die in every generation, but
which never dies as a whole. A spaceship cannot be a phoenix, and
in fact every finite phoenix eventually evolves into an oscillator.
The following 12-cell oscillator (found by the MIT group in December
1971) is the smallest known phoenix, and is sometimes called simply
"the phoenix".

This is extensible and is just the first of a family of phoenixes
made by joining components together to form a loop. Here is
another member of this family.

Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000,
Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix.
The situation for higher periods is unknown.
An easy synthesis of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as
seeds. A puffer creating a growing row of phoenixes has the
unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive
for more than one generation approaches zero. See lone dot agar
for an example of an infinite phoenix.</description>

      <description>: pi climber The reaction that defines rate of travel of the
Caterpillar spaceship. A pi climber consists of a pi-heptomino
"climbing" a chain of blinkers, moving 17 cells every 45 ticks, and
leaving behind an identical chain of blinkers, shifted downward by 6
cells. A single pi climber does not produce any gliders or other
output, but two or more of them travelling on nearby blinker chains
can be arranged to emit gliders every 45 ticks. Compare

different p30 c /5 orthogonal spaceships in which a pre-pulsar is
pushed by a pair of spiders. The back sparks of the spaceship can
be used to perturb gliders in many different ways, allowing the easy
construction of c /5 puffers. The first PPS was found by David Bell
in May 1998 based on a p15 pre-pulsar spaceship found by Noam Elkies
in December 1997. See also SPPS and APPS.
The pattern below shows the basic mechanism of a PPS. The two

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pre-pulsar</link>
      <description>: pre-pulsar A common predecessor of the pulsar, such as that shown
below. This duplicates itself in 15 generations. (It fails,
however, to be a true replicator because of the way the two copies
then interact.)

A pair of tubs can be placed to eat half the pre-pulsar as it
replicates; this gives the p30 oscillator Eureka where the
pre-pulsar's replication becomes a movement back and forth. See
twirling T-tetsons II for a variation on this idea. By other means
the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur in just 14
generations as half of it is eaten; this allows the construction of
p28 and p29 oscillators. The pre-pulsar was also a vital component
of the first known p26 and p47 oscillators.

      <title>Pseudo - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pseudo</link>
      <description>: pseudo Opposite of true. A gun emitting a period n stream of
spaceships (or rakes) is said to be a pseudo period n gun if its
mechanism oscillates with a period greater than n. This period will
necessarily be a multiple of n. If the base mechanism's period is
instead a fraction of n, then a period multiplier must also be
present which is considered to be part of the mechanism, and the gun
as a whole is still a true period gun. For example, a filter may
be used on a lower-period gun to produce a compound gun such as the
true p48 gun.
Pseudo period n glider guns are known to exist for all periods
greater than or equal to 14, with smaller periods being impossible.
All known p14 guns are pseudo guns requiring several signal
injections, so they are quite large. The following smaller example
is a pseudo period 123 gun, interleaving the streams from two true
period 246 guns:

The same distinction between true and pseudo also exists for
puffers.</description>

      <title>Puffer - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/puffer</link>
      <description>: puffer An object that moves like a spaceship, except that it leaves
debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and
travelled at c /2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very first
one, found in 1971).

Not long afterwards c /12 diagonal puffers were found (see
switch engine). Discounting wickstretchers, which are not
puffers in the conventional sense, no new velocity was obtained after
this until David Bell found the first c /3 orthogonal puffer in April
1996. Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years.
Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than c /2
have useful side or back sparks. These can be used to perturb
standard spaceships that approach from behind. A common technique
for creating puffers for a new speed uses a convoy of the new
spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship
such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as
the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a
high-period puffer for the new speed.
As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known
velocity of elementary spaceship, except for c /6 and c /7 diagonal
and (2,1) c /6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on
macro-spaceships, simply by removing some part of the trailing
cleanup mechanism.</description>

      <title>Pufferfish - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pufferfish</link>
      <description>: pufferfish ( c /2, p12) A puffer discovered by Richard Schank in
November 2014, from a symmetric soup search using an early version of
apgsearch. It consists of a pair of B-heptominoes stabilised by
a backend that leaves only pairs of blocks behind. It is simple
enough to be easily synthesized with gliders.

See soup for a random initial pattern, generated by apgsearch and
recorded in Catagolue, that produces a pufferfish.</description>

      <description>: pufferfish spaceship ( c /2, p36) Generally, any spaceship
constructed using pufferfish. May refer specifically to the
extensible c /2 spaceship constructed by Ivan Fomichev in December
2014, the first such spaceship to contain no period-2 or period-4
parts. (The first two or three rows might be considered to be period
2 or 4, but they are directly dependent on following rows for
support.).
The pattern consists of two adjacent pufferfish puffers, plus
four copies of a nontrivial period 36 c /2 fuse for pufferfish
exhaust, discovered using a randomized soup search.</description>

5533. It consists of a B-heptomino (shown here one generation
before the standard form) escorted by two LWSS. (This was the
second known puffer. The first is shown under puffer.)

In April 2006, Jason Summers found a way to make the classic puffer
train into a p20 spaceship by adding a glider at the back:</description>

      <title>Pulse divider - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pulse_divider</link>
      <description>: pulse divider A mechanism that lets every n -th object that reaches it
pass through, and deletes all the rest, where n 1 and the objects
are typically gliders, spaceships or Herschels. A common
synonym is period multiplier. For n =2, the simplest known stable
pulse dividers are the semi-Snarks.
The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter
Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block
and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will
not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original
position. The relatively small size and low period of this example
made it useful for constructing compact glider guns of certain
periods, but it became largely obsolete with the discovery of the
stable CC semi-Snark, which uses the same basic mechanism.
Period 7, 22, 36 and 46 versions of this pulse divider are also
known.</description>

      <title>Quad pseudo - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/quad_pseudo</link>
      <description>: quad pseudo A still life that can be broken down into four stable
pieces but not into two or three. This term may refer to the
following 34-bit pattern, found by Gabriel Nivasch in July 2001, or
any similar pattern with the same property.

As a consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, there can be no
analogous objects requiring decomposition into five or more pieces.
By convention, patterns like this and the triple pseudo are
considered to be pseudo still lifes, not strict still lifes. As
of June 2018, it has been shown that no quad pseudo patterns exist
with 32 or fewer bits, but a 33-bit pattern with this property may
theoretically still be found.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/quadri-Snark</link>
      <description>: quadri-Snark A period-multiplying colour-preserving signal
conduit found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2017, producing one
output glider for every four input gliders. It is made by
replacing one of the eaters in a tremi-Snark with a catalyst
found using Bellman. The catalyst causes the formation of a tub
which then requires an additional glider to delete. However, this
adds 5 ticks to the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. If period
quadrupling is needed with a colour-changing reaction, a
CP semi-Snark and a CC semi-Snark can be used in series, or a
period-multiplying Herschel conduit can be connected to a syringe
and an appropriately chosen Herschel-to-glider converter.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/queen_bee_shuttle_pair</link>
      <description>: queen bee shuttle pair Any arrangement of two queen bee shuttles
such that the two beehives created between them are consumed in
some way. There are many ways that the two shuttles can be placed,
either head-to-head, or else at right angles. The most well-known
and useful arrangement results in the Gosper glider gun.
Other arrangements don't create any lasting output, but create
large sparks which can perturb objects (especially gliders) in
various ways. For example, one arrangement of a queen bee shuttle
pair was used in the original unit Life cell as a memory cell.
Here an input glider is converted into a block, which remains until
it is deleted by a glider on a right-angled path.

See p690 gun and metamorphosis II for two more examples.</description>

      <title>Reanimation - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/reanimation</link>
      <description>: reanimation A reaction performed by a convoy of spaceships (or
other moving objects) which converts a common stationary object into
a glider without harming the convoy. This provides one way for
signals that have been frozen in place by some previous reaction to
be released for use.
Simple reactions using period 4 c /2 spaceships have been found for
reanimating a block, boat, beehive, ship, loaf, bi-block,
or toad. The most interesting of these is for a beehive since it
seems to require an unusual p4 spaceship:

Reanimation of a loaf is used many times in the Caterloopillar.
It is also used in the Caterpillar as part of its catch and throw
mechanism. Finally, reanimation can produce rakes from some
puffers. See stop and restart for a similar idea that applies to
Herschel conduits and other signal circuitry.
There are small objects which have no known reanimation reactions
using c /2 ships other than the brute force method of hitting them
with the output of rakes.</description>

      <title>Rectifier - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/rectifier</link>
      <description>: rectifier The smallest known 180-degree reflector, discovered by
Adam P. Goucher in 2009. It was the smallest and fastest stable
reflector of any kind until the discovery of the Snark in 2013. The
rectifier has the same output glider as the boojum reflector but a
much shorter repeat time of only 106 ticks.
Another advantage of the rectifier is that the output glider is on
a transparent lane, so it can be used in logic circuitry to merge
two signal paths.</description>

      <title>Reflector - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/reflector</link>
      <description>: reflector Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some
type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent
damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection
process is generally called a one-time turner instead.
The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions
as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples
include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators
based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made
into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.
In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider
reflectors, with oscillators supplying the required domino
sparks at different periods. A figure-8 produced a p8 bouncer,
and a p6 pipsquirter produced an equivalent p6 bouncer. A more
complicated construction allows a p5 bouncer (which, as had been
anticipated, soon led to a true p55 Quetzal gun). And in August
1999 Elkies found a suitable sparker to produce a p7 bouncer,
allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.
These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc.,
until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and
simple reaction, the bumper, starting with a loaf as bait
instead of a boat. This resulted in a series of periodic
colour-preserving reflectors, whereas Elkies' bouncer reflectors
are all colour-changing. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer"
contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P
and is colour-preserving.
Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain
conditions they can be used to construct oscillators of all
sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable
reflectors were possible (see universal constructor), but no one
was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so
in October 1996.
Callahan's original reflector has a repeat time of 4840, soon
improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean
Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave
Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different
method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a
method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced
this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by
Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.
In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with
a repeat time of only 202 (see boojum reflector). This reflector
won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the
prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree
reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's colour-preserving
Snark reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable
reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100
prize for a colour-changing stable reflector contained within a 25
by 25 bounding box, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.
As of June 2018, the following splitter is among the smallest
known 90-degree colour-changing reflectors. The top output can
be blocked off by an eater if needed. For small 180-degree
colour-changing reflectors see rectifier, and also the sample
pattern in splitter.</description>

      <description>: relay Any oscillator in which spaceships (typically gliders)
travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below
using two pentadecathlons. Pulling the pentadecathlons further
apart allows any period of the form 60+120 n to be achieved. This is
the simplest proof of the existence of oscillators of arbitrarily
large period.</description>

Dave Buckingham in 1972 and in the early 1980s. It accepts an
R-pentomino as input and produces an output B-heptomino 28 ticks
later. Of nine major variants known as of July 2018, four versions
are shown below. For each version, the R-pentomino inputs are shown
near the left and right edges, along with the B-heptomino output
locations near the center.

The version in the southeast is used in Paul Callahan's
Herschel receiver. The one in the northwest is part of L156, but
can be replaced by the variant in the northeast which produces a
forward glider output.</description>

      <description>: RNE-19T84 The following edge shooter converter, accepting an
input R-pentomino and producing a glider heading northeast (if the
R-pentomino is in standard orientation).

This converter has several common uses. It can be attached to the
L156 Herschel conduit to change it into a useful
period doubler. Connecting it to the initial stage of the L156
produces a composite Herschel-to-glider converter often used as a
splitter, or as a quasi- edge shooter after suppressing the
additional glider output:

The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun
collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where syringes
can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion
reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another
glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the
perpendicular glider output is suppressed.)</description>

six cells: all the others stabilize in at most 10 generations, but
the R-pentomino does not do so until generation 1103, by which time
it has a population of 116, including six gliders.

At generation 774, an R-pentomino produces a queen bee which lasts
17 more generations before being destroyed, enough time for it to
flip over. This observation led to the discovery of the
Gosper glider gun.</description>

      <description>: salvo A collection of spaceships, usually gliders, all travelling in
the same direction. Any valid glider construction recipe can be
partitioned into no more than four salvos. Compare flotilla. In
contrast with a convoy, the spaceships in a salvo are usually
consumed by the reactions that they cause. Simple examples include
block pusher and block pull.
Salvos may be slow or synchronized. The following partially
synchronized three-glider salvo produces an LWSS from a block.

The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the
second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown.
The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it
will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many ticks it is
delayed. The slow glider construction entry includes an example of
a true slow salvo.</description>

The first sawtooth was constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991.
The current smallest known sawtooth was found by a conwaylife.com
forum user with the online handle 'thunk'. It has a bounding box of
74×60, and is the smallest known sawtooth in terms of its minimum
repeating population of 177 cells. The following variant has a higher

      <title>Seed - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/seed</link>
      <description>: seed A constellation of still lifes and/or oscillators, which can
be converted into another Life object when it is struck by one or
more gliders. Usually the resulting object is a rare still life or
spaceship, more complex than the original constellation. Spartan
single-glider (1G) seeds are more commonly seen than multi-glider
seeds, because a Spartan 1G seed can be readily constructed and
triggered using a slow salvo. See also freeze-dried. For
example, the following is a 14 sL 1G seed for a c /7 loafer
spaceship.</description>

      <title>Semi-cenark - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/semi-cenark</link>
      <description>: semi-cenark Either of two semi-Snark variants discovered by Tanner
Jacobi in November 2017. The name is due to the initial converter,
which produces a century output for every two input gliders. The
minimum safe repeat time is 43 ticks for the smaller initial
catalyst shown in CC semi-cenark and CP semi-cenark, or 42
ticks with the slightly larger catalyst variant shown below. There
is also overclocking possible at period 36, 38, or 39. The reset
glider can be followed immediately by a new trigger glider, as shown
below, so the minimum repeat time for an intermittent stream of
gliders is only 50 ticks.</description>

      <title>Signal elbow - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/signal_elbow</link>
      <description>: signal elbow A conduit with signal output 90 degrees from its
input. This term is commonly used only for signal wires,
particularly 2c/3 signals. A Snark could reasonably be called a
"glider elbow", but glider reflector is the standard term. A
signal elbow with a recovery time less than 20 ticks would enable a
trivial proof that Conway's Life is omniperiodic.
A near miss is the following elbow-like converter found by Dean
Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2 c /3 signal by 90 degrees, but
unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process.
This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended
(e.g., to make a closed loop).

Relatively small composite MWSS elbows can now be constructed,
using Tanner Jacobi's 2015 discovery of a small H-to-MWSS
component. For example, the Orthogonoid includes a
constructor/reflector that reflects an MWSS stream by 180 degrees,
but it can be trivially reconfigured to make a 90-degree MWSS elbow.</description>

      <title>Slide gun - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/slide_gun</link>
      <description>: slide gun A gun which fires sideways from an extending arm. The
arm consists of streams of spaceships which are pushing a pattern
away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every
time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a
different path.
Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994
(although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following
pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders
shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the
length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an
output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide
guns using other reactions.)</description>

      <title>Sliding block memory - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/sliding_block_memory</link>
      <description>: sliding block memory A memory register whose value is stored as the
position of a block. The block can be moved by means of glider
collisions. See block pusher for an example.
In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the
existence of a universal computer in Life) two gliders were used to
pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and
thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.

Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to
pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push
it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to
be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It
suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway
did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as
Hickerson did).
Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's
URM, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex
constructions, such as David Bell's Collatz 5N+1 simulator and Adam
P. Goucher's pi calculator and Spartan
universal computer -constructor.</description>

      <title>Slow glider construction - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/slow_glider_construction</link>
      <description>: slow glider construction Construction an object by a "slow salvo" of
gliders all coming from the same direction, in such a way that
timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too
close behind one another. This type of construction requires an
initial seed object, such as a block, which is modified by each
glider in turn until the desired object is produced.
In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a
block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53
gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of
sparse Life, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the
first few generations collide with blonks and other debris.
Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for
universal constructors. However, in this case the above definition
is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow
constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have
a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much
greater flexibility, as blinkers can now be freely used in the
intermediate construction steps. The Snarkmaker is a very large p2
slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following edgy
construction of an eater1 starting from a block.

Adam P. Goucher's slmake search program, made available in May
2017, makes it much easier to find a slow glider construction for a
wide variety of stable circuitry.</description>

      <title>Snacker - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/snacker_(1)</link>
      <description>: snacker (p9) Found by Mark Niemiec in 1972. This is a
pentadecathlon with stabilizers which force it into a lower period.

The stabilizers make the domino spark largely inaccessible, but the
snacker is extensible, as shown in the next diagram, and so a more
accessible p9 domino spark can be obtained. In April 1998 Dean
Hickerson found an alternative stabilizer that is less obtrusive than
the original one, and this is also shown in this diagram.

An end can also be stabilized by killer candlefrobras.</description>

      <title>Soup - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/soup</link>
      <description>: soup A random initial pattern, either contained within a small area,
or alternatively filling the whole Life universe.
Finite soups probably have behaviors very different than infinite
soups, but this is obviously unknown. Infinite soups may remain
chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound
to happen somewhere.
Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on
that. See sparse Life for a discussion of what can happen at a low
density.
Finite soups for sizes such as 16×16 (asymmetric) have been
examined by the billions by scripts such as apgsearch to find
interesting results. Many new oscillators and synthesis
recipes have been discovered, as well as previously known rare
patterns such as stabilized switch engines. In addition, soups are
used to generate statistical census data, and to decide whether
specific objects can be considered natural.
Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be symmetric.
The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric
soups tend to create large symmetrical objects at a much higher rate.
Shown below is an unusual mirror-symmetric soup that produces a
pufferfish and nothing else.</description>

      <title>Spacefiller - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/spacefiller</link>
      <description>: spacefiller Any pattern that grows at a quadratic rate by filling
space with an agar. The first example was found in September 1993
by Hartmut Holzwart, following a suggestion by Alan Hensel. The
diagram below shows a smaller spacefiller found by Tim Coe. See also
Max. Spacefillers can be considered as breeders (more precisely,
MMS breeders), but they are very different from ordinary breeders.
The word "spacefiller" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon
became the accepted term.</description>

      <title>Sparking eater - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/sparking_eater</link>
      <description>: sparking eater One of two eaters found in April 1997 and November
1998 by Dean Hickerson using his dr search program, shown below
to the left and right respectively. These both absorb gliders as a
standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit sparks
at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders
with different phases as shown.

The above mechanisms can be used to build intermitting glider guns.
The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider
impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't
be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten
ticks after impact, which allows p4 N guns to be used.
The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform
other perturbations"around the corner" of some objects. For
example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a
row of ten AK47 reactions to form a much smaller period 94 glider
gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the
AK94 gun.)</description>

      <title>Speed booster - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/speed_booster</link>
      <description>: speed booster Any mechanism which allows a signal (indicated by the
presence or absence of a spaceship) to move faster than the spaceship
could travel through empty space. The original speed booster is
based on p30 technology, and is shown below:

Here the top glider is boosted by passing through two
inline inverters, emerging 5 cells further along than the unboosted
glider at the left.
The fastest speed boosters are the telegraph and p1 telegraph,
which can transfer a orthogonal signal at the speed of light,
although their bit rate is rather slow.
Diagonal speed boosters have also been built using 2c/3 wires or
other stable components. See stable pseudo-Heisenburp.
The star gate seems like it can transfer a signal faster than the
speed of light. The illusion is explained in
Fast Forward Force Field.</description>

      <title>Splitter - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/splitter</link>
      <description>: splitter A signal converter that accepts a single input signal
and produces two or more output signals, usually of the same type as
the input. An older term for this is fanout, or "fanout device".
A sub-category is the one-time splitter, which is not technically
a converter because it can only be used once. One-time splitters are
usually small constellations that produce two or more clean
gliders when struck by a single glider. In other words, they are
multi-glider seeds. These are important for constructing
self-destruct circuitry in self-constructing spaceships.
The following combination, a syringe attached to an SE7T14
converter combined with an NW31 converter, is one of the smallest
known glider splitters as of July 2018. Another small splitter with
a 90-degree colour-changing output is shown under reflector.</description>

      <title>Stabilized switch engine - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/stabilized_switch_engine</link>
      <description>: stabilized switch engine A single switch engine which survives
indefinitely by interacting with the appropriate exhaust such that
it prevents the engine from ever being destroyed.
The only known types of stabilized switch engines were found by
Charles Corderman soon after he discovered the switch engine itself.
There is a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and
the p384 glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most
natural infinite growth patterns in Life. As of June 2018 they are
the basis for every infinite growth pattern ever seen to occur from a
random asymmetric soup, even after trillions of census results by
apgsearch and similar projects.
Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen
under infinite growth, and one giving rise to a glider-producing
switch engine is shown under time bomb.
Here is the block-laying type showing its distinctive zig-zag trail
of blocks.</description>

      <title>Stamp collection - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/stamp_collection</link>
      <description>: stamp collection A collection of oscillators (or perhaps other Life
objects) in a single diagram, displaying the exhibits much like
stamps in a stamp album. The classic examples are by Dean Hickerson
(see http://conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/stamps.html).
Many stamp collections contain "fonts" made of single cells (which
cleanly die) to annotate the objects or to draw boxes around them.
For example, here is a stamp collection which shows all the ways that
two gliders can create a loaf or an eater :

Alternatively, stamp collections can use LifeHistory for their
annotations, but this requires a more sophisticated Life program to
handle. Numbers, or more rarely letters, are sometimes constructed
from stable components such as blocks or snakes, but their
readability is somewhat limited by placement constraints.</description>

      <title>Still life - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/still_life</link>
      <description>: still life Any stable pattern, usually assumed to be finite and
nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this
definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair
of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be
an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.
For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a
stable pattern as a strict still life only if its islands cannot
be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in
their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can
be referred to as a constellation. If its cells form a single
cluster it is also, more specifically, either a pseudo still life
or a quasi still life.
In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be
divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into
two. See the 32-bit triple pseudo (32 bits) and the 34-bit
quad pseudo for examples.
All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be
glider constructible. It is an open question whether all still
lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For
a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially
useful in self-constructing circuitry, see also Spartan.
The smallest still life is the block. Arbitrarily large still
lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a canoe or
barge. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can
be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of zebra stripes or
chicken wire, among many other options. See density for more
precise limits.</description>

      <title>Stop and restart - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/stop_and_restart</link>
      <description>: stop and restart A type of signal circuit where an input signal
is converted into a stationary object, which is then re-activated by
a secondary input signal. This can be used either as a memory device
storing one bit of information, or as a simple delay mechanism. In
the following January 2016 example by Martin Grant, a
ghost Herschel marks the output signal location, and a "ghost
beehive" marks the location of the intermediate still life.

The eater1 in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if
no input signal has come in to create the beehive. This eater could
be removed if it is useful to have both a "0" and a "1" output for a
memory cell mechanism.
The catch and throw technology in a Caterpillar is a somewhat
similar idea. See also stop and go and reanimation.</description>

      <title>Strict volatility - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/strict_volatility</link>
      <description>: strict volatility A term suggested by Noam Elkies in August 1998 for
the proportion of cells involved in a period n oscillator which
themselves oscillate with period n. For prime n this is the same as
the ordinary volatility. Periods with known strictly-volatile
oscillators include 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 22, 30, 33, and 177.
Examples include figure-8, Kok's galaxy, smiley, and
pentadecathlon. A composite example is the following p22, found by
Nicolay Beluchenko on 4 March 2009:</description>

      <title>Superstring - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/superstring</link>
      <description>: superstring An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one
side so that it moves at the speed of light, often leaving debris
behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald
and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by
Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many
different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen
Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)
Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run
between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a fuse which can be
made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony
Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring
itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one
blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the
track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be
used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this
example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track
consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides
known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It
would be interesting to find one that remains intact.
See titanic toroidal traveler for another example of a
superstring.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/SW1T43</link>
      <description>: SW1T43 A Herschel-to-glider converter that produces a
tandem glider useful in the tee reaction. It is classified as a
"G3" converter because its two gliders are three lanes apart.

Besides the southwest-travelling glider on lane 1, the converter also
emits the Herschel's standard first natural glider, SW-2. The
converter's full standard name is therefore "HSW1T43_SW-2T21". See
NW31 for an explanation of H-to-G naming conventions.</description>

      <description>: SW-2 The simplest type of H-to-G converter, where the converter's
effect is simply to suppress a Herschel cleanly after allowing its
first natural glider to escape. The name should be read as "SW
minus two", where -2 is a glider lane number. The complete
designation is SW-2T21. See NW31T120 for a discussion of the
standard naming conventions used for these converters.
An unlimited number of converters have the SW-2T21 classification.
The variants most often used consist of just one or two small
still life catalysts.</description>

      <title>Switch - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/switch</link>
      <description>: switch A signal -carrying circuit that can send output signals to
two or more different locations, depending on the state of the
mechanism. These may be toggle circuits, where the state of the
switch changes after each use, or permanent switches that retain
the same state through many uses until a change is made with a
separate signal.
More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it
can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the
following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by
Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an
incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby
block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs.

The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance
syringe variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not
technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard Herschel
source can deliver the signal to the block factory (the two
eater1s on the right side of the pattern). Alternate converter
mechanisms could also be used to place the block.
An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism,
also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 H-to-G. See
also bistable switch for a very robust and versatile toggle switch
with two input lanes and four possible outputs.</description>

      <title>Switch engine - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/switch_engine_(1)</link>
      <description>: switch engine The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman
in 1971, which is a glide symmetric unstable puffer which moves
diagonally at a speed of c /12 (8 cells every 96 generations).

The exhaust is dirty and unfortunately catches up and destroys
the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found
several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce puffers,
using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See
stabilized switch engine and ark.
No spaceships were able to be made from switch engines until Dean
Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see Cordership).
Switch engine technology is now well-advanced, producing many c /12
diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.
Small polyominoes exist whose evolution results in a switch
engine. See nonomino switch engine predecessor.
Several three-glider collisions produce dirty reactions that
produce a stabilized switch engine along with other ash, making
infinite growth. Until recently the only known syntheses for
clean unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There
are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider
arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to,
making it easier to repeat the reaction:

Running the above for 20 ticks completes a kickback reaction with
the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine
recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.</description>

      <title>Symmetric - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/symmetric</link>
      <description>: symmetric Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis
and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as
the block, beehive, pond, loaf, clock, and blinker are
symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are Kok's galaxy,
Achim's p16, cross, Eureka, and the pulsar.
Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple
copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless
the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered
trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two LWSSs
travelling together a hundred cells apart).
There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an
object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of
cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or
rows, and can have a gutter. Even symmetry occurs when the line of
reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects
with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.
Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all
symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their evolution.
Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve,
but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single
object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two
gliders interact to form a blockade :

Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This
commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to
change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing
of new cells at their gutter interface. Examples of this are
twin bees shuttle, centinal, and the object shown in puffer.
Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric
object using nearby oscillators or spaceships in a symmetric
manner. Examples of this are Schick engine, blinker ship, and
hivenudger.
Many spaceships found by search programs are symmetric because
the search space for such objects is much smaller than for
non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include dart, 60P5H2V0, and
119P4H1V0.</description>

      <title>Syringe - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/syringe</link>
      <description>: syringe A small stable converter found by Tanner Jacobi in March
2015, accepting a glider as input and producing an output Herschel
As of June 2018 it is the smallest known converter of this type, so
it is very often used to handle input gliders in complex signal
circuitry, as described in Herschel circuit. A second glider can
safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but overclocking
also allows the syringe to work at a repeat time of 74 or 75 ticks.
If followed by a dependent conduit a simple eater2 can be used
instead of the large welded catalyst shown here. A
ghost Herschel marks the output location.

A different version of the large catalyst, with better clearance
for some situations, can be seen in the switch entry.</description>

      <title>Tagalong - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>

      <description>: tagalong An object which is not a spaceship in its own right, but
which can be attached to one or more spaceships to form a larger
spaceship. For examples see Canada goose, fly, pushalong,
sidecar and sparky. See also Schick engine, which consists of
a tagalong attached to two LWSS (or similar).
The following c/4 spaceship (Nicolay Beluchenko, February 2004)

if either wing is removed, then the remaining wing becomes an
essential component of the spaceship, and so is no longer a tagalong.</description>

      <title>Tanner's p46 - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Tanners_p46</link>
      <description>: Tanner's p46 (p46) An oscillator found by Tanner Jacobi on 20
October 2017. This oscillator hassles an evolving pi-heptomino to
produce an phi spark. The spark is very accessible and is able
to perturb many things.

The snakes can be replaced with eaters to form a slightly smaller
version, as shown in the p46 MWSS gun in gliderless
The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old
twin bees shuttle, and so this is able to expand the known p46
technology. For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a
Tanner's p46 and just one of the twin bees shuttles.
Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right
angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two
different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun. See
p46 gun and gliderless for two of these. These are the first p46
guns found which do not use a twin bees shuttle at all.</description>

common oscillator, although blinkers are more than a hundred
times as frequent. See also killer toads. A toad can be used as a
90-degree one-time turner.

The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by
encouraging and then suppressing births on successive ticks. For
example, a toad can replace the northwest eater in the
Callahan G-to-H converter, allowing it to be packed one diagonal
cell closer to other circuits.</description>

reaction involves a Herschel predecessor rather than an actual
Herschel, the following diagram shows instead a B-heptomino (which

      <title>Transparent lane - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/transparent_lane</link>
      <description>: transparent lane A path through a signal-producing circuit that can
be used to merge signal streams. The signal is usually a
standard spaceship such as a glider. It can either be produced
by the circuit, or it can come from elsewhere, passing safely through
on the same lane without interacting with the circuit. A good
example is the NW31 converter, which has two glider outputs on
transparent lanes:

The optional third output shown in NW31 is non-transparent,
because the upper eater1 catalyst would get in the way of a passing
glider on the same lane.</description>

      <title>Trigger - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/trigger</link>
      <description>: trigger A signal, usually a single glider, that collides with a
seed constellation to produce a relatively rare still life or
oscillator, or an output spaceship or other signal. The
constellation is destroyed or damaged in the process; compare
circuit, reflector. Here a pair of trigger gliders strike a
dirty seed constellation assembled by Chris Cain in March 2015, to
launch a three-engine Cordership :
"Trigger" is also used when a spaceship reacts with another object
to cause a reaction to occur whenever desired (but perhaps only at
particular intervals). The object being triggered lies dormant
until the reaction is required. All turners and freeze-dried
constellations are triggerable.
In some cases the object is not destroyed so that the reaction can
be repeated after some repeat time. See for example converter
and reflector, and more specifically MWSS out of the blue and
queen bee shuttle pair.</description>

      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/trivial_(1)</link>
      <description>: trivial A trivial period- N oscillator is one in which every cell
oscillates at some smaller factor of N. See omniperiodic. For
example, the joining of a period 3 and a period 4 oscillator as
shown below creates a single object which is a trivial oscillator of
period 12.

However, there are trivial oscillators that meet this requirement,
but may still be considered to be non-trivial because the
different-period rotors are not separated by stator cells. An
example is Dean Hickerson's trivial p6. Conversely, there are
oscillators formed by trivial combinations of high-period guns or
sparkers that are only technically non-trivial, because the
lower-period components overlap but do not interact in any way."Trivial" is also used to describe a parent of an object which
has groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result,
such as isolated faraway cells. For example, here is a trivial
parent of a block.</description>

      <title>Trombone slide - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/trombone_slide</link>
      <description>: trombone slide An arrangement of four 90-degree reflectors that can
be placed into the path of a glider so as to delay it by an
adjustable number of generations, without changing its lane. More
generally, any combination of circuits may be referred to as a
trombone slide, if the grouping can be moved as a single unit that
functions as a 180-degree glider reflector.
The smallest known trombone slides are made using Snarks. In the
trombone slide shown below, sample input and output gliders are
shown. The input glider will reach the same output location 128
generations sooner if the trombone slide is removed.
If the top and left Snarks are moved together diagonally to the
upper left by N cells, then the glider delay is increased by 8 N
generations since the glider has to travel N more cells in each
direction. This sliding action gives the trombone slide its name.
If only the final Snark is moved, then the output glider's path can
be altered by a number of full diagonals.

Trombone slides made of the same type of component cannot alter the
glider path by half-diagonals, and can only change the timing by
multiples of 8 generations. For other timing changes, different
components are necessary. These may be stable like the
Silver reflector or the colour-changing example shown in the
reflector article, or periodic like the various bumpers.</description>

      <description>: tubstretcher Any wickstretcher in which the wick is two diagonal
lines of cells forming, successively, a tub, a barge, a
long barge, etc. The first one was found by Hartmut Holzwart in
June 1993, although at the time this was considered to be a
boatstretcher (as it was shown with an extra cell, making the tub
into a boat). The following small example is by Nicolay Beluchenko
(August 2005), using a quarter.

In October 2005, David Bell constructed an adjustable high-period
diagonal c /4 rake that burns tubstretcher wicks to create
gliders, which are then turned and duplicated by convoys of
diagonal c/4 spaceships to re-ignite the stabilized ends of the
same wicks.</description>

      <title>Turner - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/turner</link>
      <description>: turner A one-time glider reflector, or in other words a
single-glider seed (the term is seldom or never used in relation to
spaceships other than gliders). One-time turners may be 90-degree or
180-degree, or they may be 0-degree with the output in the same
direction as the input. A reusable turner would instead be called a
reflector. Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner
reactions that use common small ash objects: boat, eater1,
long boat, and toad.

Of the reactions on the first row, the glider output is the same
parity for all but the long boat. The three still lifes are all
colour-changing, but the toad happens to be a colour-preserving
turner. The third row shows an aircraft carrier serving as a
"0-degree turner" that is also colour-changing.
Three of the simplest 180-degree turners are shown in the second
row. The Blockic 180-degree turner is colour-preserving. The
long boat and long ship are again colour-changing; this is
somewhat counterintuitive as the output glider is on exactly the same
lane as the input glider, but gliders travelling in opposite
directions on the same lane always have opposite colours.
Many small one-time turner constellations have also been
catalogued. The 90-degree two-block turner on the right, directly
below the toad, is also colour-changing but has the opposite parity.
A one-time turner reaction can be used as part of a glider
injection mechanism, or as a switching mechanism for a signal.
If a previous reaction has created the sacrificial object, then a
later glider is turned onto a new path. Otherwise it passes through
the area unaffected. This is one way to create simple switching
systems or logic circuits. An example is shown in demultiplexer.</description>

      <title>Twin bees shuttle - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/twin_bees_shuttle</link>
      <description>: twin bees shuttle (p46) Found by Bill Gosper in 1971, this was the
basis of all known true p46 guns, and all known p46 oscillators
except for glider signal loops using Snarks, until the
discovery of Tanner's p46 in 2017. See new gun for an example.
There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown
in the diagram. On the left is David Bell's double block reaction
(which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on
the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method
produces the very large twin bees shuttle spark which is useful in
a number of ways. See metamorphosis for an example. Adding a
symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See
also p54 shuttle.</description>

      <description>: twin bees shuttle spark The large and distinctive long-lived spark
produced, most commonly, by the twin bees shuttle. It starts off
as shown below.

After 3 generations it becomes symmetric along the horizontal axis,
after 9 generations it becomes symmetric along the vertical axis
also, and finally dies after 18 generations.
Since the spark is isolated and long-lived, there are many possible
perturbations that it can perform. One of the most useful is
demonstrated in metamorphosis where a glider is converted into a
LWSS. Another useful one can turn a LWSS by 90 degrees:</description>

      <title>Volatility - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/volatility</link>
      <description>: volatility The volatility of an oscillator is the size (in cells)
of its rotor divided by the sum of the sizes of its rotor and its
stator. In other words, it is the proportion of cells involved in
the oscillator which actually oscillate. For many periods there are
known oscillators with volatility 1, see for example Achim's p16,
figure-8, Kok's galaxy, mazing, pentadecathlon, phoenix,
relay, smiley and tumbler. Such an oscillator of period 3 was
found in August 2012 by Jason Summers.

The smallest period for which the existence of such statorless
oscillators is undecided is 7. There are oscillators with volatility
arbitrarily close to 1 for all but finitely many periods, because of
the possibility of feeding the gliders from a true period n gun
into an eater.
The term "volatility" is due to Robert Wainwright. See also
strict volatility.</description>

      <title>Wavestretcher - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/wavestretcher</link>
      <description>: wavestretcher A spaceship pattern that supports a connection to an
extensible periodic wick -like structure, whose speed and/or
direction of propagation are different from those of the
wavestretcher spaceship.
Connecting the following to a standard diagonal antstretcher
creates a new oblique wavestretcher (a type of growing spaceship)
and also an alternate space nonfiller mechanism.

A required supporting c /5 spark is shown at the right edge. It can
be supplied by a spider or another c /5 orthogonal spaceship with a
similar edge spark. Alternatively, the c /5 component could
theoretically be replaced by a supporting spaceship travelling
diagonally at c /6, to support the same oblique trail of ants. As of
June 2018 no workable c /6 component has been found.</description>

      <title>Wickstretcher - John Conway’s Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/wickstretcher</link>
      <description>: wickstretcher A spaceship -like object which stretches a wick that
is fixed at the other end. The wick here is assumed to be in some
sense connected, otherwise most puffers would qualify as
wickstretchers. The first example of a wickstretcher was found in
October 1992 (front end by Hartmut Holzwart and back end by Dean
Hickerson) and stretches ants at a speed of c /4. This is shown
below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following
month.

Diagonally moving c /4 and c /12 wickstretchers have also been built:
see tubstretcher and linestretcher. In July 2000 Jason Summers
constructed a c /2 wickstretcher, stretching a p50 traffic jam wick,
based on an earlier (October 1994) pattern by Hickerson. A c /5
diagonal wickstretcher was found in January 2011 by Matthias
Merzenich, who also discovered a c /5 orthogonal wickstretcher two
years later in March 2013.</description>

      <description>: with the grain A term used for negative spaceships travelling in
zebra stripes agar, parallel to the stripes, and also for
with-the-grain grey ships.
Below are three small examples of "negative spaceships" found by
Gabriel Nivasch in July 1999, travelling with the grain through a
stabilized finite segment of zebra stripes agar:

It has been proven that signals travelling non-destructively with the
grain through zebra stripes cannot travel at less than the
speed of light.</description>
