<p>Each 2<i>c</i>/3 signal is made up of two half-signals that can be

<p>Considerable effort has been spent on finding a way to turn a 2<i>c</i>/3
signal 90 or 180 degrees, since this would by one way to prove Life
to be <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>. There is a known 2<i>c</i>/3 converter shown under
<a href="#s9v">signal elbow</a>, which converts a standard 2<i>c</i>/3 signal into a
double-length signal. This is usable in some situations, but
unfortunately it fails when its input is a double-length signal, so
it can't be used to complete a loop.
<p>Noam Elkies discovered a glider synthesis of a reaction that can
repeatably insert a signal into the upper end of a 2<i>c</i>/3 wire. See
<a href="#r66">stable pseudo-Heisenburp</a> for details. On 11 September 2017, Martin
Grant reduced the input reaction to five gliders, or three gliders

<p>The first two gliders collide to produce a <a href="#ndw">traffic light</a> and
glider. The other two gliders react symmetrically with the evolving
<a href="#ndw">traffic light</a> to form four gliders. A <a href="#y7q">glider gun</a> can be built by
using <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a> to turn four of the output gliders so that they

Conway's Life and a wide variety of other rules. Development of the

(self-modifying, 256-bit SIMD compatibility), development continues
in 2017 with apgluxe (Larger Than Life and Generations rules, more
soup shapes). Several customized variants of the Python script have
also been created by other programmers, to perform types of searches
not supported by Goucher's original apgsearch 1.&times;.
<p>All of these versions of the search utility work with a "haul" that
usually consists of many thousands or millions of random soup
patterns. Each soup is run to stability, and detailed object
<a href="#y9n">census</a> results are reported to <a href="#x0g">Catagolue</a>. For any rare objects
discovered in the <a href="#fdc">ash</a>, the source soup can be easily retrieved from

<a href="#mst">methuselah</a> that evolves into three <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>, two <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> and a
<a href="#ch9">ship</a> after 148 generations. Compare with <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>, which appears
at generation 20 of the B-heptomino's evolution. B-heptominoes
acquired particular importance in 1996 due to Dave Buckingham's work
on <a href="#bfp">B tracks</a>. See in particular
<a href="#cg9">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>.

<p>This pattern often arises with the cell at top left shifted one
space to the left, producing a seven-bit <a href="#l51">polyplet</a> that shares the
same eight-bit descendant but is not technically a heptomino at all.
This alternate form is shown as the input for <a href="#abo">elementary</a>
<a href="#gra">converter</a> patterns such as <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a> and <a href="#p6k">BRx46B</a>. This is standard
practice for elementary <a href="#u15">conduits</a>, since many of these conduits do
in fact produce this alternate form as output.
<p>The B-heptomino is considered a failed <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> or failed
<a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, since on its own it travels at <i>c</i>/2 for only a short time
before being affected by its own trailing debris. However, it can be
stabilized into a <i>c</i>/2 puffer or into a <a href="#nhx">clean</a> <i>c</i>/2 rake or spaceship.

          <p>A <a href="#ret">Spartan</a> <a href="#g5g">memory cell</a> found by Paul Callahan in
1994. It can be in one of two states, containing either a <a href="#i0n">boat</a> or
a <a href="#dp5">block</a>. Input gliders on the appropriate paths can change the boat
to a block, or vice-versa, while also emitting an output glider.
Unlike many memory cells, attempts to change the state to the one it
is already in are ignored with the glider passing through with no
reaction. This makes it easy to reset the memory cell to a known
state. Which of the two states is considered the SET and which
considered the RESET is just a matter of convention.
<p>The pattern below shows the "boat" state of the memory cell in its
original 1994 form. Two gliders are also shown to indicate the input
paths used to change the states. A smaller version is shown under
<a href="#vp1">century eater</a>, with the circuit in its "block" state.
<p>As shown, the rightmost glider changes the state from a boat to a
block and emits a glider to the upper right, while the leftmost
glider passes through unchanged. Alternatively, when the state
contains a block, then the leftmost glider changes the state from a
block to a boat, and emits a glider to the lower right, while the
rightmost glider passes through unchanged.

          <p>Any <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> whose output is <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a>. However, the
term is particularly used for p8 <i>c</i>/2 puffers. The first such blinker
puffer was found by Robert Wainwright in 1984, and was unexpectedly
simple:
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/blinker_puffer_(1)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/blinker_puffer_(1).png" width="119" height="218" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’blinker_puffer_(1)’"></a></p>

Since then many more blinker puffers have been found. The following
one was found by David Bell in 1992 when he was trying to extend an
<a href="#q4q">x66</a>:
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/blinker_puffer_(2)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/blinker_puffer_(2).png" width="207" height="295" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’blinker_puffer_(2)’"></a></p>

The importance of this larger blinker puffer (and others like it), is
that the engine which produces the blinker output is only p4. The
blinker row produced by the puffer can easily be ignited, and the
resulting <a href="#exg">blinker fuse</a> burns cleanly with a speed of 2<i>c</i>/3. When
the burning catches up to the engine, it causes a <a href="#op2">phase change</a> in
the puffer. This fact allows p8 blinker puffers to be used to
construct rakes of all periods which are large multiples of four.

<p>In January 1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while
setting it to 0. A <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> is fired at the boat-bit. If it is
already 0 (absent) then the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1
(present) then the boat and the MWSS are destroyed and, with the help
of an <a href="#uic">eater1</a>, converted into a glider which travels back along
exactly the same path that is used by the gliders that toggle the
boat-bit.

There are many other equivalent methods based on alternate incoming
test <a href="#j4d">signals</a>.

taken from Lewis Carroll's _The Hunting of the Snark_, referring to
the fact that a small 90-degree stable reflector was really what was
wanted. 180-degree reflectors are relatively undesirable and have
limited use in larger circuitry constructions.
<p>The boojum reflector was the smallest and fastest known stable
reflector until the discovery of the <a href="#h8b">rectifier</a> in 2009, followed by

          <p>Any pattern whose <a href="#n9e">population</a> grows at a quadratic rate,
although it is usual to exclude <a href="#yq2">spacefillers</a>. It is easy to see
that this is the fastest possible growth rate.
<p>The term is also sometimes used to mean specifically the breeder
created by Bill Gosper's group at MIT, which was the first known
pattern exhibiting <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>.
<p>There are four common types of breeder, known as MMM, MMS, MSM and
SMM (where M=moving and S=stationary). Typically an MMM breeder is a
<a href="#fnm">rake</a> <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>, an MMS breeder is a puffer producing puffers which
produce stationary objects (<a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> and/or <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>), an
MSM breeder is a <a href="#xtd">gun</a> puffer and an SMM breeder is a rake gun. There
are, however, less obvious variants of these types. Other less
common breeder categories (SSS, hybrid MSS/MSM, etc.) can be created
with some difficulty, based on <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> technology;
see <a href="#ylp">Pianola breeder</a>.
<p>The original breeder was of type MSM (a p64 puffer puffing p30
glider guns). The known breeder with the smallest initial population
is <a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a>.

          <p>A reaction which travels indefinitely as a <a href="#p5v">wave</a> through the
components of a <a href="#vac">wick</a> or an <a href="#dsi">agar</a>. A burning wick is known as a
<a href="#odj">fuse</a>.
<p>If the object being burned has a spatial periodicity, then the
active area of the burning usually remains bounded and so eventually
develops a periodicity too. It is unknown whether this will always
occur.
<p>The speed of burning can range from arbitrarily slow up to the
<a href="#ups">speed of light</a>. The results of burning can be clean (leaving no
debris), or leaving debris usually much different from the original
object. In rare cases, a <a href="#ekr">reburnable fuse</a> produces an exact copy of
the original object, allowing the creation of objects such as the
<a href="#mzy">telegraph</a>.
<p>In many useful cases burning can be initiated by impacting an
object with <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or other <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>. An object might be able
to burn in more than one way, depending on how the burn is initiated.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A family of adjustable-speed <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> constructed
by Michael Simkin in 2016, based on an "engineless caterpillar" idea
originally proposed by David Bell. The front and back halves of
Caterloopillars each function as universal constructors, with each
half constructing the building blocks of the other half, while also
reading and moving a construction tape. The overall design is
reminiscent of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Drawing Hands". The name
"Caterloopillar" is a reference to Douglas Hofstader's Strange Loop
concept.
<p>Simkin has written an automated script that can construct a
Caterloopillar for any rational speed strictly less than <i>c</i>/4, with
some exceptions. Speeds closer to the <i>c</i>/4 limit in general require
larger constructions, and for any given computer system it is easy to
choose a speed that makes it impractical to construct a
Caterloopillar.
<p>As of June 2018 one significant remaining exception is that
Caterloopillars with periods <i>c</i>/(6+4<i>N</i>) can't be constructed. This is
only a limitation of the current construction script, not of the
underlying Caterloopillar <a href="#uxc">toolkit</a>. For technical reasons, the
lowest speed that the current script can produce is around <i>c</i>/95. The
slowest Caterloopillars that have been explicitly constructed to date
are <i>c</i>/87 and <i>c</i>/92. These are among the smallest in terms of
population, though their bounding boxes are larger than some of the
higher-speed Caterloopillars.

          <h2>Caterpillar</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> that works by laying tracks at its front
end. The first example constructed was a p270 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship built
by Gabriel Nivasch in December 2004, based on work by himself, Jason
Summers and David Bell. This Caterpillar has a population of about
12 million in each generation and was put together by a computer
program that Nivasch wrote. At the time it was by far the largest
and most complex Life object ever constructed, and it is still one of
the largest in terms of population.
<p>The 17<i>c</i>/45 Caterpillar is based on the following reaction between a
<a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a> and a <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>:
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/Caterpillar_(1)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/Caterpillar_(1).png" width="196" height="75" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’Caterpillar_(1)’"></a></p>

In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45
generations, while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.
This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in
September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to
build a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which
pi-heptominoes crawling along two rows of blinkers interact to emit a
glider every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions
were later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic
idea of the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in
this way can be used to construct fleets of <a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a>
which convey gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they
can be used to build more blinkers.
<p>A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following
reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31
generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling
glider. In this case the tracks would be waves of backward-moving
gliders.

          <h2>cellular automaton</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A certain class of mathematical objects of which
<a href="#mj0">Life</a> is an example. A cellular automaton consists of a number of
things. First there is a positive integer <i>n</i> which is the dimension
of the cellular automaton. Then there is a finite set of states <i>S</i>,
with at least two members. A state for the whole cellular automaton
is obtained by assigning an element of <i>S</i> to each point of the
<i>n</i>-dimensional lattice <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> (where <span class="b">Z</span> is the set of all integers). The
points of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> are usually called cells. The cellular automaton also
has the concept of a neighbourhood. The neighbourhood <i>N</i> of the
origin is some finite (nonempty) subset of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>. The neighbourhood of
any other cell is obtained in the obvious way by translating that of
the origin. Finally there is a transition rule, which is a function
from <i>S</i><sup><i>N</i></sup> to <i>S</i> (that is to say, for each possible state of the
neighbourhood the transition rule specifies some cell state). The
state of the cellular automaton evolves in discrete time, with the
state of each cell at time <i>t</i>+1 being determined by the state of its
neighbourhood at time <i>t</i>, in accordance with the transition rule.
<p>There are some variations on the above definition. It is common to
require that there be a quiescent state, that is, a state such that
if the whole universe is in that state at generation 0 then it will
remain so in generation 1. (In Life the OFF state is quiescent, but
the ON state is not.) Other variations allow spaces other than <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>,
neighbourhoods that vary over space and/or time, probabilistic or
other non-deterministic transition rules, etc.
<p>It is common for the neighbourhood of a cell to be the 3&times;...&times;3
(hyper)cube centred on that cell. (This includes those cases where
the neighbourhood might more naturally be thought of as a proper
subset of this cube.) This is known as the Moore neighbourhood.

          <p>Opposite of <a href="#yx7">dirty</a>. A reaction which produces a small number
of different products which are desired or which are easily deleted
is said to be clean. For example, a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which produces just one
object per period is clean. Clean reactions are useful because they
can be used as building blocks in larger constructions.
<p>When a <a href="#odj">fuse</a> is said to be clean, or to <a href="#cb2">burn</a> cleanly, this
usually means that no debris at all is left behind.

          <p>A uniquely effective method of adding a glider to the

converting it to a glider using a one-bit <a href="#eh8">spark</a>. Here it rebuilds

<p>In 2015 Chris Cain used this reaction to demonstrate conclusively
that any unidirectional glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>, no matter how large or
tightly packed, can be constructed by collisions between gliders that
are initially separated by any finite distance. As a corollary,
because all glider syntheses are made up of two to four
unidirectional salvos, any glider-constructible object has a
synthesis that starts with every glider at least <i>N</i> cells away from
every other glider (for any chosen <i>N</i>).

          <h2>colour of a glider</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>The colour of a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> is a property of the
glider that remains constant while the glider is moving along a
straight path, but that can be changed when the glider bounces off a
<a href="#vj8">reflector</a>. It is an important consideration when building
something using reflectors.
<p>The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First choose
some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered to be
white, and all other cells to be black or white in a checkerboard
pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) is white if <i>m</i>+<i>n</i> is
even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of a glider is the
colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase that can be rotated
to look like this:

<p>A reflector that does not change the colour of gliders obviously
cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than
it started on. But a 90-degree reflector that does change the colour
of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the resulting
glider will depend only on the direction of the glider, no matter how
many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility, therefore, both
types of reflector are required.
<p>Small periodic colour-changing glider reflectors (<a href="#uxt">bouncers</a>) are
known, and also small periodic colour-preserving glider reflectors
(<a href="#onm">bumpers</a>). Among stable patterns, only a small colour-preserving
reflector (<a href="#wvr">Snark</a>) is known. The smallest known 90-degree
colour-changing reflector is given at the end of the <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>

          <p>One of the components of a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> in a
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>. The elbow usually consists of a single
<a href="#ret">Spartan</a> still life or small constellation. It accepts
<a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> recipes, in the form of <a href="#i1v">salvos</a> coming from the
construction arm's <a href="#hir">shoulder</a>.
<p>These recipes may do one of several things: 1) <a href="#fye">pull</a> the elbow
closer to the shoulder, 2) <a href="#gh5">push</a> the elbow farther from the
shoulder, 3) emit a glider on a particular output <a href="#aii">lane</a> (while also
optionally pushing or pulling the elbow); 4) create a "<a href="#ns5">hand</a>" target
block or other useful object as a target for output gliders, to one
side of the <a href="#mfc">construction lane</a>; 5) duplicate the elbow, or 6)
destroy the elbow.
<p>Elbows that receive and emit orthogonally-travelling <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>
instead of gliders are technically possible, but no working examples
are currently known. The discussion below assumes that gliders are
used to communicate between the shoulder, elbow, and hand locations.
<p>If a mechanism can be programmed to generate recipes for at least
the first three options listed above, it is generally capable of
functioning as a <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>. The main requirement is
that push and pull <a href="#f4l">elbow operations</a> should be available that are
either minimal (1<a href="#hpm">fd</a>) or the distances should be relatively prime.
<p>Depending on the <a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> library, there may be only one
type of elbow, or there may be two or more elbow objects, with
recipes that convert between them. The <a href="#rdh">9hd</a> library had just one
elbow type, a block. The original 10<a href="#hv0">hd</a> library had two elbows,
blocks in mirror-symmetric locations; this was expanded to a larger
list for the <a href="#yis">10hd Demonoid</a>. The <a href="#nxn">0hd Demonoid</a> also has a
multi-elbow recipe library. A <a href="#q0o">slow elbow</a> toolkit may make use of
an even larger number of glider output recipes, because the <a href="#qir">target</a>
elbow object in that case is not restricted to a single diagonal
line.
<p>If only one colour, parity, or phase of glider can be emitted, then
the mechanism will be limited to producing <a href="#gk1">monochromatic salvos</a> or
<a href="#qct">monoparity salvos</a>. These are less efficient at most construction
tasks, but are still generally accepted to enable
<a href="#ijt">universal toolkits</a>. See also <a href="#c85">half-baked knightship</a>.

<p>The following diagram shows a p8 <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a>-to-<a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>
converter. This was originally found by Dave Buckingham in a larger
form (using a <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> instead of the <a href="#i0n">boat</a>). The improvement
shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter Leithner has
since found (much larger) <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of periods 44, 46 and 60 that
can be used instead of the <a href="#jif">Kok's galaxy</a>.

<p>For another periodic converter, see the glider-to-LWSS example in
<a href="#ix9">queen bee shuttle pair</a>. However, many converters are <a href="#qup">stable</a>.
Examples of <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a> converters include <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a>,
<a href="#iq2">135-degree MWSS-to-G</a>, and <a href="#i8z">45-degree MWSS-to-G</a>.
<p>The earliest and simplest stable converters known are shown below.
These are an HWSS-to-loaf, MWSS-to-beehive, and LWSS-to-blinker.
These can serve as <a href="#g5g">memory cells</a>, or as the first steps in
constructing objects using <a href="#i1v">salvos</a>.

          <p>A simple <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> <a href="#tka">circuit</a> consisting of three
<a href="#uic">eater1s</a>, found by Brice Due in August 2006. An input Herschel
places a boat in a location accessible to an input glider. If the
boat is present, a <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a> reaction occurs and the glider
is turned 90 degrees onto a new lane.

If the Herschel and boat are removed from the above pattern, the
glider passes cleanly through the circuit. It can be used as the "0"
output of a one-bit <a href="#g5g">memory cell</a>, where the 90-degree output would
be the "1" output. This was the method used to store presence or
absence of neighbor <a href="#xis">metacells</a> in the <a href="#t7o">p1 megacell</a>.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>The density of a pattern is the limit of the proportion of
live cells in a (2<i>n</i>+1)&times;(2<i>n</i>+1) square centred on a particular cell as
<i>n</i> tends to infinity, when this limit exists. (Note that it does not
make any difference what cell is chosen as the centre cell. Also
note that if the pattern is finite then the density is zero.) There
are other definitions of density, but this one will do here.
<p>In 1994 Noam Elkies proved that the maximum density of a stable
pattern is 1/2, which had been the conjectured value. See the paper
listed in the bibliography. Marcus Moore provided a simpler proof in
1995, and in fact proves that a <a href="#gt3">still life</a> with an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i>
<a href="#p6q">bounding box</a> has at most (<i>mn</i>+<i>m</i>+<i>n</i>)/2 cells.
<p>But what is the maximum average density of an oscillating pattern?
The answer is conjectured to be 1/2 again, but this remains unproved.
The best upper bound so far obtained is 8/13 (Hartmut Holzwart,
September 1992).
<p>The maximum possible density for a <a href="#kv9">phase</a> of an oscillating
pattern is also unknown. An example with a density of 3/4 is known
(see <a href="#dsi">agar</a>), but densities arbitrarily close to 1 may perhaps be
possible.

          <p>A <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> in which the input <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
interacts with catalysts in the first few ticks. The standard
interaction actually starts at T=-3, before the Herschel is
completely formed. Compare <a href="#sr2">independent conduit</a>. The Herschel is
prevented from emitting its <a href="#ebs">first natural glider</a>. This is useful
in cases where the previous conduit cannot survive a first natural
glider emitted from its output Herschel.
<p>This term is somewhat confusing, since it is actually the previous
conduit that depends on the dependent conduit to suppress the
problematic glider. Dependent conduits such as the <a href="#ba2">F166</a> and
<a href="#amz">Lx200</a> do not actually depend on anything. They can be freely
connected to any other conduits that fit, as long as the output
Herschel evolves from its standard great-grandparent. As of this
writing, the <a href="#dv1">Fx158</a> is the only known case where a conduit's output
Herschel has an alternate great-grandparent, which is incompatible
with dependent conduits' initial transparent block.

          <p>The most common type of test reaction in
<a href="#g5g">memory cell</a> circuitry. Information is stored in a memory cell by
placing objects in known positions, or by changing the state of a
stable or periodic <a href="#on7">toggle circuit</a>. A destructive-read test
consists of sending one or more <a href="#j4d">signals</a> to the memory cell. A
distinct output signal is produced for each possible state of the
memory cell, which is reset to a known "zero" or "rest" state. See
for example <a href="#u19">boat-bit</a>, <a href="#eqy">keeper</a>, and <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.
<p>To permanently store information in a destructive-read memory cell,
the output signal(s) must be used, in part, to send appropriate
signals back to the memory cell to restore its state to its previous
value. With output looped back to input, this larger composite
circuit then effectively becomes a <a href="#i2f">non-destructive read</a> memory

          <p>Usually simply called an <a href="#v1v">eater</a>, and also called a
fishhook.

<p>This eater can be constructed using a simple two-glider collision,
as shown in <a href="#g4c">stamp collection</a>. It is often modified in various
ways, or <a href="#s6n">welded</a> to other objects, to allow tighter packing of
<a href="#tka">circuits</a> or to allow a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#goz">stream</a> to pass close by. See
<a href="#ng0">clearance</a> for an eater1 variant that is 1<a href="#hv0">hd</a> shorter to the
southeast than the standard fishhook form. An eater1 can also be
used as a 90-degree <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a>.
<p>Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by Bill Gosper in
1971. The fishhook eater can consume a glider, a <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, and a
<a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> as shown below. It is not able to consume an <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>, however.
See <a href="#a38">honey bit</a> or <a href="#w4d">killer toads</a> for that.

          <p>This <a href="#v1v">eater</a> was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary <a href="#uic">eater1</a> but with two slight
differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes longer to
recover from each bite, and it can eat objects appearing at two
different positions.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/eater2_(1)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/eater2_(1).png" width="97" height="97" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’eater2_(1)’"></a></p>

The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a
<a href="#p9q">glider</a> in a position that would destroy an <a href="#uic">eater1</a>. This novel
glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined
with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders travelling
along four adjacent glider <a href="#aii">lanes</a>, as shown below.
<p>The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be
useful for obtaining smaller <a href="#p6q">bounding boxes</a>. A more compact
variant with the same purpose can be seen under <a href="#k51">gliderless</a>.

The <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> can take bites out things, being flipped over in the

eat <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>, but it can be used for various other purposes. The
four NE-most centre cells regrow in a few generations after being

different directions. Also called the tub-with-tail eater (TWIT), it

unwanted gliders in <a href="#u15">conduits</a>. Below is the standard form, a compact
form with a <a href="#oed">long hook</a>, and an often-useful conjoined form found

<p>With gliders from either direction, the eater5's eating reaction
creates a <a href="#eh8">spark</a> that can be used to reflect other gliders. See the
example pattern in <a href="#l2f">duoplet</a>, or advance any of the topmost three
gliders in the above pattern by two <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> which has an edge that possesses
no <a href="#eh8">spark</a> and yet is able to <a href="#l7k">perturb</a> things because of its ability
to repair certain types of damage to itself. The most useful
examples are the following two small p3 <a href="#oxm">c/3 spaceships</a>:

These were found by David Bell in 1992, but the usefulness of the
edge-repair property wasn't recognised until July 1997. The
following diagram (showing an edge-repair spaceship deleting a
<a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>) demonstrates the self-repairing action.

In October 2000, David Bell found that a <a href="#m50">T-tetromino</a> component of a
<a href="#fmh">c/4 spaceship</a> can also be self-repairing. Stephen Silver noticed
that it could be used to delete beehives and, in November 2000, found
the smallest known <i>c</i>/4 spaceship with this edge-repair component - in
fact, two copies of the component:

<p>Stable edge shooters became possible with the development of

commonly used is Buckingham's <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a>, which transforms a
<a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a> into an inverted <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> in 59 ticks. The BFx59H
elementary conduit is a component in many of the original <a href="#mk4">universal</a>
<a href="#uxc">toolkit</a> of Herschel conduits. An extension of the same naming
convention is used for elementary conduits, with the first and last
letters of the name specifying the input and output <a href="#j4d">signal</a> objects.
As with Herschels, an arbitrary orientation and center point is
chosen for each object. "Fx" means the signal moves forward and
produces a mirror-image output. See <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> for further
details.
<p>Theoretically an elementary conduit may become a composite conduit,
if another conduit can be found that shares the beginning or end of
the conduit in question. In practice this happens only rarely,
because many of the most likely branch points have already been
identified: <a href="#p9q">glider</a> (G), <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> (L) or <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> (M), <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> (H),

<a href="#w3v">wing</a> (W). A <a href="#q14">Herschel descendant</a> might qualify, due to the
elementary conduit that can be seen in the <a href="#ell">p184 gun</a>. However,
there are very few simple conduits that produce Herschel descendants
without Herschels, so in practice this is not a useful branch point.

          <p>The following reaction found by Dieter
Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the
gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow
the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6
generations.

<p>The illusion of super-light-speed travel is caused by an LWSS that
is always created, but is then destroyed in some cases, by a signal
catching up to it from behind that necessarily never travels faster
than the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>. It is not possible to make any use of the
apparent super-light-speed signal. The front end of an output LWSS
can't be distinguished from the alternative dying <a href="#eh8">spark</a> output
until several more ticks have passed. Not surprisingly, this extra
time is enough to drop the average speed of information transmission
safely below <i>c</i>.
<p>Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his
favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.

          <p>A term used for a <a href="#ciy">glider constructible</a> <a href="#fnr">seed</a> that can
activated in some way to produce a complex object. For example, a
"freeze-dried salvo" is a constellation of constructible objects
which, when <a href="#idj">triggered</a> by a single glider, produces a unidirectional
glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>, and nothing else. Freeze-dried salvos can be useful
in <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> constructions, especially when an active circuit has
to destroy or reconstruct itself in a limited amount of time.
Gradual modification by a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> may be too slow, or the
circuit doing the construction may itself be the object that must be
modified.
<p>The concept may be applied to other types of objects. For example,
one possible way to build a gun for a <a href="#jbk">waterbear</a> would be to program
a construction arm to build a freeze-dried waterbear seed, and then
trigger it when the construction is complete.

<p>This edge shooter has an unusually high 27<a href="#hv0">hd</a> clearance, one of
the highest known for a single small component. The only known
higher-clearance edge shooters are injectors making use of multiple
interacting spaceships. This makes the Fx119 inserter ideal for the
construction of wide <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> whose total width can fit within its
clearance distance.
<p>The component creates a large cloud of <a href="#ogq">smoke</a> behind its emitted
glider which lasts for over 90 generations. In spite of this, many
tightly packed convoys can be made by injecting later gliders behind
others in the convoy, helped along by the insertion reaction which is

place a glider on the same lane as a passing glider and as close as
15 ticks behind, which is only one step away from the minimum

          <p>A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only
occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with
cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was
known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because
of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a
wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been
constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This
example was 9 &times; 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the
University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 &times; 122 example. The following
shows a 12 &times; 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006,
based on a 13 &times; 12 one found by Achim Flammenkamp in June 2004.

<p>Below is a 10&times;10 Garden of Eden found by Marijn Heule, Christiaan
Hartman, Kees Kwekkeboom, and Alain Noels in 2013 using SAT-solver
techniques. An exhaustive search of 90-degree rotationally symmetric
10&times;10 patterns was possible because the symmetry reduces the number
of unknown cells by a factor of four.

<p>Steven Eker has since found several asymmetrical Gardens of Eden

          <p>A type of self-constructing circuitry that borrows key ideas
from Andrew Wade's <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship, but with several
simplifications. The main feature common to the Gemini spaceship is
the construction recipe encoding method. Information is stored
directly, and much more efficiently, in the timings of moving
gliders, rather than in a static tape with 1s and 0s encoded by the
presence of small stationary objects.
<p>Unlike the original Gemini, Geminoids have <a href="#rb5">ambidextrous</a>
construction arms, initially using glider pairs on two lanes
separated by 9<a href="#hv0">hd</a>, 10hd, or 0hd. The design was the basis for the
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a> and the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a>. A more recent development
is a Geminoid toolkit using a <a href="#way">single-channel</a> construction arm,
which allows for the possibility of multiple elbows with no loss of
efficiency, or the construction of temporary lossless elbows.
Compare <a href="#q0o">slow elbow</a>.
<p>Other new developments that could be considered part of the

salvos and seeds, used when objects must be built within a short time

GIG usually consists of a small number of oscillators.
<p>For example, in July 1996 Dieter Leithner found the following

most useful glider duplicators are those with low <a href="#ve5">periods</a>.
<p>The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple
mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input glider stream comes in
from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper
and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an
<a href="#hng">inverting reflector</a> is required to complete the duplicator. To
produce non-parallel output, an <a href="#lui">inline inverter</a> could be
substituted for the northmost p30 glider gun.

<p>Spaceship <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> that can duplicate gliders are very useful
since they (along with <a href="#ix1">glider turners</a>) provide a means to clean up
many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to
impact into the <a href="#csj">exhaust</a> to clean it up.
<p>Glider duplicators and turners are known for backward gliders using
p2 <i>c</i>/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 <i>c</i>/3 spaceships.
These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.

way to construct <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> and <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a> guns involved gliders, and
it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner constructed the
first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).
<p>In October 2017 Matthias Merzenich used two copies of
<a href="#nfc">Tanner's p46</a> to create a p46 MWSS gun. This is the smallest known
gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun.

          <p>Construction of an object by means of <a href="#p9q">glider</a>
collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be
arranged so that they could come from infinity. That is, gliders
should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the

<p>Glider syntheses for all <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> and known <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> with
at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham. As of June 2018,
this limit has been increased to 18 cells.
<p>Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, because these can be used to create corresponding
<a href="#xtd">guns</a> and <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>. Many of the <i>c</i>/2 spaceships that are based on
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a> have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec.
In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the
<a href="#we6">Corderships</a> (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers
used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies
suggested that a 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be
a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a
synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in
March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform
the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build
a <i>c</i>/2 forward rake for the 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship; this was the first example
in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same
direction as the rake but more slowly.
<p>A 3-glider synthesis of a <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a> is shown in the diagram
below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a
surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three
gliders would already be known.

on the <a href="#nkc">half-bakery reaction</a>. This was the first spaceship based on
this reaction, constructed in December 2014 by Adam P. Goucher. It
moves 6 cells horizontally and 3 cells vertically every 2621440+8<i>N</i>
ticks, depending on the relative spacing of the two halves. It is
one of the slowest known <a href="#nl7">knightships</a>, and the first one that was
not a <a href="#gf5">Geminoid</a>. Chris Cain optimized the design a few days later to
create the <a href="#bf1">Parallel HBK</a>.
<p>The spaceship produces gliders from near-diagonal lines of
half-bakeries, which collide with each other at 180 degrees. These
collisions produce <a href="#gk1">monochromatic salvos</a> that gradually build and
trigger <a href="#fnr">seeds</a>, which in turn eventually construct small
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> <a href="#i1v">salvos</a> of gliders. These re-activate the lines of
half-bakeries, thus closing the cycle and moving the entire spaceship
obliquely by (6,3).

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A Life algorithm by Bill Gosper that is designed to take
advantage of the considerable amount of repetitive behaviour in many
large patterns of interest. It provides a means of evolving
repetitive patterns millions (or even billions or trillions) of
generations further than normal Life algorithms can manage in a
reasonable amount of time.
<p>The hashlife algorithm is described by Gosper in his paper listed
in the bibliography at the end of this lexicon. Roughly speaking,
the idea is to store subpatterns in a hash table so that the results
of their <a href="#t2z">evolution</a> do not need to be recomputed if they arise again
at some other place or time in the evolution of the full pattern.
This does, however, mean that complex patterns can require
substantial amounts of memory.
<p>Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow implemented Hashlife into
<a href="#s47">Golly</a> in 2005. See also <a href="#xd9">macrocell</a>.

<p>The name is commonly ascribed to the Herschel heptomino's
similarity to a planetary symbol. William Herschel discovered Uranus
in 1781. However, in point of fact a Herschel bears no particular
resemblance to either of the symbols used for Uranus, but does
closely resemble the symbol for Saturn. So the appropriate name might
actually be "Huygens", but "Herschel" is now universally used by
tradition.
<p>Herschels are one of the most versatile types of <a href="#j4d">signal</a> in stable
circuitry. <a href="#rax">R-pentominoes</a> and <a href="#saf">B-heptominoes</a> naturally evolve into
Herschels, and <a href="#gra">converters</a> have also been found that change
<a href="#se4">pi-heptominoes</a> and several other signal types into Herschels, and
vice versa. See <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a>.

          <h2>Herschel circuit</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A series of <a href="#j58">Herschel conduits</a> or other components,
connected by placing them so that the output <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a> from early
conduits become the input Herschels for later conduits. Often the
initial component is a <a href="#gra">converter</a> accepting some other signal type
as input - usually a glider, in which case a <a href="#fzn">syringe</a> is most
commonly used. The <a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a> is a well-known early
<a href="#ret">Spartan</a> Herschel circuit from before the syringe was discovered,
where the initial converter is a <a href="#ogp">Callahan G-to-H</a>.
<p>Sometimes a direct connection between two conduits is not possible
due to unwanted gliders that destroy required <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>, or wanted
gliders that are not able to escape. In this case, small "spacer"
conduits such as <a href="#awl">F116</a>, <a href="#awm">F117</a>, <a href="#lfj">Fx77</a>, <a href="#s7l">R64</a>, <a href="#g9o">L112</a>, or <a href="#gkk">L156</a> can
be inserted between the other conduits to solve the problem.
<p>Some converter or <a href="#wle">factory</a> conduits do not produce a Herschel as
output, instead generating other useful results such as gliders,
<a href="#i0n">boats</a> or <a href="#dfv">MWSSes</a>. See <a href="#rai">Herschel-to-glider</a>, <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>, and
<a href="#rhe">H-to-MWSS</a> respectively for examples of these. For those conduits
which do produce an unwanted Herschel, an <a href="#v1v">eater</a> such as <a href="#fxr">SW-2</a> can
be added to delete it.
<p>If the first and last conduits of a chain connect to each other in
a loop then there is no need for a syringe to generate the first
Herschel, or an eater to consume the last one. The circuit becomes a
self-supporting <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a>. A loop is also formed by a
<a href="#fzn">syringe</a> connected to a Herschel-to-glider converter, with the
glider reflected back to the syringe's input with glider reflectors
of the appropriate colour, usually <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a>. In either case, if the
loop has a surplus <a href="#p9q">glider</a> output, it becomes a <a href="#xtd">gun</a>; if no output
is available it is an <a href="#ipa">emu</a>.

to another. See also <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a>.
<p>Well over a hundred simple stable Herschel conduits are currently
known. As of June 2018 the number is approximately 150, depending on
the precise definition of "simple" - e.g., fitting inside a 100&times;100
bounding box, and producing output in no more than 300 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>. In
general a Herschel conduit can be called "simple" if its active
reaction does not return to a Herschel stage except at its output.
Compare <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a>, <a href="#fx0">composite conduit</a>. A description of
common usage in complex circuitry, using <a href="#fzn">syringes</a> and <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a> to
make compact connections, can be found in <a href="#iod">Herschel circuit</a>.
<p>The original <a href="#mk4">universal</a> set consisted of sixteen stable Herschel
conduits, discovered between 1995 and 1998 by Dave Buckingham (DJB)
and Paul Callahan (PBC). These are shown in the following table. In
this table, the number in "name/steps" is the number of <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>
needed to produce an output Herschel from the input Herschel. "m"
tells how the Herschel is moved (R = turned right, L = turned left, B
= turned back, F = unturned, f = flipped), and "dx" and "dy" give the
displacement of the centre cell of the Herschel (assumed to start in
the orientation shown above).

<p>Dependent conduit inputs are catalysed by a <a href="#o6q">transparent</a> block
before the Herschel's standard form can appear, and before the
Herschel's <a href="#ebs">first natural glider</a> is produced. This means that these
conduits will fail if an actual Herschel is placed in the "correct"
input location for a dependent conduit. Refer to <a href="#ba2">F166</a> or <a href="#amz">Lx200</a>
to see the correct relative placement of the standard transparent

          <p>Any mechanism that can retrieve a signal from a
spaceship <a href="#aii">lane</a> while allowing spaceships on nearby lanes to pass by
unaffected. In practice the spaceship is generally a glider. The
signal is removed from the lane, an output signal is generated
elsewhere, and the highway robber returns to its original state. A
competent highway robber does not affect gliders even on the lane
adjacent to the affected glider stream, except during its recovery
period.
<p>A perfect highway robber doesn't affect later gliders even in the
lane to which it is attached, even during its recovery period. Below
is a near-perfect highway robber "bait" that requires three
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> signals to rebuild (the <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>, <a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a>, and
<a href="#p9q">glider</a>.) The glider at the top right passes by unharmed, but
another glider following on the same <a href="#aii">lane</a> 200 ticks later will be
cleanly reflected to a new path, and another glider following that
one will also pass by unharmed. The only imperfection is a few ticks
at the very end of the reconstruction, as the beehive is being
rebuilt:

          <h2>honey bit</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A block and pond <a href="#th3">constellation</a> used in the
<a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a> by Brice Due in 2006, to store and retrieve a bit of
data - specifically, the presence or absence of a neighbor
<a href="#xis">metacell</a>. The "0" state of the honey bit memory unit is a simple
<a href="#ktx">beehive</a>, which is also the source of the name.
<p>An input glider collides with the beehive to convert it into the
honey bit constellation, which can be thought of as a value of "1"
stored in the memory unit. A passing LWSS can then test for the
presence of the pond. If a collision occurs, the LWSS and the honey
bit constellation are mutually annihilated, leaving just the original
beehive. Below is the honeybit constellation with the two reactions
occurring in the opposite order - test, then reset.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/honey_bit_(1)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/honey_bit_(1).png" width="207" height="207" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’honey_bit_(1)’"></a></p>

If the pond is not present, the LWSS passes by the beehive without
affecting it. Thus a test input has an output for the "0" case, but
not for the "1" case. For an alternative memory-unit mechanism with
both "0" and "1" outputs, see <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.
<p>The honey bit is also an interesting <a href="#v1v">eater</a> for the <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a> as
shown below. An HWSS colliding with the pond happens to create the
exact same reset glider used in the above memory unit.

"infinite hotel" scenario in which a hotel with an infinite number of
rooms has room for more guests even if it is already full, simply by
shuffling the old guests around.
<p>In this pattern, two pairs of <a href="#we6">Corderships</a> moving at <i>c</i>/12 are

into the glider track (see <a href="#tv3">LWSS-glider bounce</a>), joining the gliders
already circulating there. The number of gliders in the track
therefore increases without limit.
<p>The tricky part of this construction is that even though all the
previously injected gliders are repeatedly flying through the
injection point, that point is guaranteed to be empty when it is time
for the next glider to be injected.

          <h2>infinite growth</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Growth of a finite pattern such that the <a href="#n9e">population</a>
tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is
used for growth of something other than population (for example,
length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth.
The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the
<a href="#mp9">Gosper glider gun</a>, created in a response to a $50 prize challenge
by John Conway. Martin Gardner's October 1970 article described the
challenge as "Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without
limit", but Conway later explained that he had always expected that
this would be disproved. The original purpose in investigating CA
rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule
could support a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a> and/or <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of
these would be possible.
<p>An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a
pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman
found that a <a href="#i53">switch engine</a> could be stabilized by a <a href="#vvb">pre-block</a> in
a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite
growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until
Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with
infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below,
which is much neater, being a single <a href="#tsb">cluster</a>. This produces a
stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/infinite_growth_(1)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/infinite_growth_(1).png" width="108" height="86" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’infinite_growth_(1)’"></a></p>

Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan showed in October 1997 that there is no
infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that question
has now been answered.
<p>In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision
that produces a glider-producing <a href="#tlb">stabilized switch engine</a> and thus
produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders
(since all 71 <a href="#uha">2-glider collisions</a> have a finite limit population).
<p>Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by
Callahan), which is the only 5&times;5 pattern with infinite growth. This
too emits a block-laying switch engine.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/infinite_growth_(2)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/infinite_growth_(2).png" width="75" height="75" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’infinite_growth_(2)’"></a></p>

<p>Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in
May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This
pattern was very large (12470&times;1 in the first version, reduced to
5447&times;1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an
exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39&times;1 pattern
shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines,
stability being achieved at generation 1483.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/infinite_growth_(3)"><img src="/lexicon/pix/infinite_growth_(3).png" width="449" height="31" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’infinite_growth_(3)’"></a></p>

Larger patterns have since been constructed that display
<a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a>.
<p>Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that
is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are
possible, <a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a> (see also <a href="#q4w">breeder</a>) being the fastest.
Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates,
such as <a href="#lge">sawtooths</a> and a <a href="#tyd">caber tosser</a>. Another pattern with
superlinear but non-quadratic growth is <a href="#y9d">Gotts dots</a>.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A reaction in which a hole in a regular spaceship stream is
filled partially or fully by adding a new spaceship of the same type
without affecting the existing spaceships in the stream. Depending
on the period of the stream, different mechanisms can be used. For
adding a spaceship to an existing multi-lane <a href="#lx2">convoy</a>, see
<a href="#nxt">inserter</a>.
<p>For large period glider streams, simple reactions such as
<a href="#orn">LWSS-LWSS bounce</a> and <a href="#tv3">LWSS-glider bounce</a> suffice. If <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
technology is used, a large number of <a href="#he2">edge shooters</a> and
<a href="#o6q">transparent</a> conduits are known. Simple examples include the <a href="#wyz">NW31</a>
<a href="#rai">Herschel-to-glider</a> <a href="#gra">converter</a> and the <a href="#wv7">Fx119 inserter</a>.
<p>Shown below is an injector found by Dave Buckingham that can fill a
hole in a p15 glider stream:

For very low-period glider streams, a <a href="#plf">GIG</a> is a much more efficient
insertion method, in the sense that fewer <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> <a href="#j4d">signals</a>
are needed. However, it has been shown that colliding gliders can
complete an insertion even into a single-glider gap in a period-14
stream.

intermittent stream such that if a spaceship arrives at a specific

          <p>Despite the name, an intermitting glider gun
(IMG) is more often an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> than a <a href="#xtd">gun</a>. There are two
basic types. A type 1 IMG consists of two guns firing at one another
in such a way that each gun is temporarily disabled on being hit by a
glider from the other gun. A type 2 IMG consists of a single gun
firing at a 180-degree glider <a href="#vj8">reflector</a> in such a way that
returning gliders temporarily disable the gun.
<p>Both types of IMG can be used to make glider guns of periods that
are multiples of the base period. This is done by firing another gun
across the two-way <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> of gliders in the IMG in
such a way that gliders only occasionally escape.

          <p>A device which can be used to invert the presence or absence
of spaceships in an <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> of spaceships. The device
must be a gun whose period matches the base period of the stream,
since if there are no input spaceships then the device must produce
spaceships as the result of the inversion. Typically the spaceships
are gliders, and the inverter is made from a glider gun. Inverters
provide a way to produce a NOT logic operation on a stream.
<p>There are several ways to produce an inverter. The simplest method
is to simply hit the output of a gun with the input stream to delete
its spaceships, producing an output stream that is always turned 90
degrees from the input stream. An example is the northernmost p30
gun in the <a href="#pzu">glider duplicator</a> example pattern. For one way to
produce an inverted output stream which is not turned, see

<p>A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at least 6.

<p>By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of

camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. Such
spaceships do exist (see <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>) but small
elementary versions are even more difficult to search for. Any of

spaceship, or less trivially by reprogramming one of the more recent
small <a href="#gf5">Geminoid</a> <a href="#bwp">construction arms</a>, but as of July 2018 a camelship

<p>An open problem related to lightspeed bubbles was whether large

the tapering back edge). This was solved in February 2017 by Arie
Paap; a simple period-2 solution is shown below.

          <p>A <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which produces its output by means of an
orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel.
The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994,
based on a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart.
The following month Holzwart found a way to make <a href="#dwr">extensible</a> <i>c</i>/2
line puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the
following day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large
widths these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions
of generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the
instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable
and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of
width, although neither of these things has been proved.
<p>Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult
periods for <i>c</i>/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally
periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be
impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a>. (See <a href="#y5g">frothing puffer</a> for another method of
constructing such periods.) In particular, the first <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#fnm">rake</a> with
period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when David
Bell constructed a p42 <a href="#cn0">backrake</a> by means of line puffers.

<p>The LWSS possesses a <a href="#dxv">tail spark</a> which can easily <a href="#l7k">perturb</a> other
objects which grow into its path. The spaceship can also perturb
some objects in additional ways. For examples, see <a href="#sav">blinker ship</a>,
<a href="#uml">hivenudger</a>, and <a href="#eth">puffer train</a>.
<p>Dave Buckingham found that the LWSS can be synthesized in several
different ways using three gliders, and can be constructed from two
gliders and another small object in several more ways. Here is the
fastest <a href="#or5">synthesis</a>:

          <h2>macrocell</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A format used by <a href="#s47">Golly</a> and its <a href="#dtq">hashlife</a> algorithm,
capable of storing repetitive patterns very efficiently, even if they
contain a large number of cells. For example, a filled square 2<sup>167</sup>
cells on a side can be stored in less than three kilobytes in
macrocell format, or about 800 bytes in compressed macrocell format.
The square's total population is over a googol, 10<sup>100</sup>; the number of
atoms in the observable universe is only about 10<sup>80</sup>.
<p>This high level of compression is obtained by defining a tree
structure composed of increasingly large cell "tiles" with
power-of-two dimensions. Tile definitions of any size are re-used
whenever they appear multiple times in a large pattern (at the same
power-of-two offset). For example, the following is a macrocell
encoding of a complex <a href="#sma">pseudo still life</a> arrangement of <a href="#ch9">ships</a>,
with a total population over 2500 cells:
<pre>
	[M2] (golly 3.0)
	#R B3/S23
	.OO.OO$O.O.O.O$OO...OO$$OO...OO$O.O.O.O$.OO.OO$
	4 0 1 1 1
	5 2 0 2 2
	6 3 3 0 3
	7 4 4 4 4
</pre>
<p>The first line after the #R rule line defines a quadtree tile at
the lowest level - a level-3 tile in this case, meaning a 2<sup>3</sup> square
area. At this level the pattern is encoded in a modified ASCII
format with dollar signs as line separators. The next line, #2,
defines a level-4 quadtree tile, made from one empty level-3 tile in
the northwest corner (0), and three copies of the level-3 tile that
was defined on the previous line (1). Lines 3, 4, and 5 similarly
define level 5, 6, and 7 quadtree tiles by giving the line numbers of
four tiles of the next lower size.
<p>Many patterns are only moderately repetitive, so macrocell format
is somewhat less successful at compressing them. Certainly most
patterns are not nearly as regular as the artificial example above:
there are usually many different tiles defined at each level, not
just one. Chaotic patterns, such as <a href="#fdc">ash</a> from random <a href="#dnq">soups</a>,
usually need so many different tile definitions that they can be
stored more efficiently using <a href="#bx2">rle</a> format.

          <p>A type of information storage <a href="#tka">circuit</a> useful in many
patterns that perform complex logical operations. Most commonly a
memory cell can store a single bit of information. See for example
<a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>, <a href="#a38">honey bit</a>, and <a href="#u19">boat-bit</a>. Depending on the
application, the circuit may be a <a href="#on7">toggle circuit</a> or a
<a href="#j70">permanent switch</a>, or it may be possible to send one or more signals
to set the circuit to a "1" state, as can be done with a <a href="#eqy">keeper</a>
mechanism. In that case a different input signal must be used to
test the current state, usually with a <a href="#dak">destructive read</a> reaction.
<p>A more complicated example can be found in the <a href="#sy8">Osqrtlogt</a> pattern,
which destructively reads a growing 2-dimensional array of minimal
memory cells. Each memory cell may either contain a <a href="#i0n">boat</a> (below
left) or empty space (below right), with no permanent circuitry
anywhere near:

<a href="#z8l">turner</a> for an incoming <a href="#p9q">glider</a>. If the boat is present, it acts
as a second one-time turner for that glider, sending back a "1"
signal. The "backstop" <a href="#dp5">block</a> in the northeast is destroyed cleanly
in either the "0" or the "1" case.

          <p>A <a href="#q4w">breeder</a> constructed by Nick Gotts in September 1998.
The original version had an initial population of 103, which was then
the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth (beating
the record previously held by <a href="#mwj">Jaws</a>). This was reduced to 97 by
Stephen Silver the following month, but was then almost immediately
superseded by <a href="#fpz">mosquito2</a>.
<p>Mosquito1 consists of the classic <a href="#eth">puffer train</a> plus four <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>
and four <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> (mostly in <a href="#mgk">predecessor</a> form, to keep the population

<a href="#dsi">agar</a> such as <a href="#wss">zebra stripes</a>. The leading edge of the signal
removes the agar, and the trailing edge rebuilds the agar some time
later. The distance between the two edges is sometimes adjustable,
as shown in <a href="#gwe">lightspeed bubble</a>. The central part of the "spaceship"
may consist of dying sparks or even simple empty space.
<p>Below is a sample period-5 negative spaceship, found by Hartmut
Holzwart in March 2007, in a small stabilized section of
<a href="#wss">zebra stripes</a> agar:

The "spaceship" travels to the left at the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>, so it
will eventually reach the edge of any finite patch and destroy itself
and its supporting agar.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>One of the most common stable <a href="#he2">edge shooters</a>. This
<a href="#rai">Herschel-to-glider</a> <a href="#gra">converter</a> suppresses the junk ordinarily left
behind by an evolving <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> while allowing both the
<a href="#ebs">first natural glider</a> and <a href="#db3">second natural glider</a> to escape on
<a href="#qgn">transparent lanes</a>:
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/NW31"><img src="/lexicon/pix/NW31.png" width="295" height="295" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’NW31’"></a></p>

The edge shooter output at the top has no additional <a href="#ng0">clearance</a>, so
its use in creating <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> is limited: it can only add gliders on
the outermost lanes of an existing glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>. Like the beehive
version of <a href="#fxr">SW-2</a>, either output can be used to build logical OR
gates, where multiple input <a href="#j4d">signal</a> paths are merged onto the same
output path.
<p>The complete name for this converter is "NW31T120", where 31 is the
output glider lane number. In the above orientation, lane numbers
get bigger toward the upper right and smaller toward the lower left
(and may easily be negative).
<p>The T120 timing measurement means that a canonical NW glider placed
on lane 31 at time T=120, at (+31, +0) relative to the input
Herschel, would in theory reach the exact same spacetime locations as
the converter's output glider does.
<p>Most converters are not edge shooters and their output lanes are
not transparent, so they usually have catalysts that would interfere
with this theoretically equivalent glider. This is the case for the
optional third glider output created by the lower <a href="#uic">eater1</a> catalyst:
the upper eater1 overlaps its <a href="#aii">lane</a>. For the alternate <a href="#dp5">block</a>
catalyst suppressing this glider output, see <a href="#qgn">transparent lane</a>.

Herschel conduits in 1996 (see
<a href="#cg9">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>) left only a short
list of unresolved cases, all with periods of 58 or below. The list
has been progressively reduced since then. Most recently, period 43
and 53 oscillators were made possible in 2013 by Mike Playle's
<a href="#wvr">Snark</a>. As of June 2018, no oscillators are known for periods 19,
23, 38, or 41. If we insist that the oscillator must be

<p>The construction recipe is a stream of MWSSes, with the recovery
time limited to 90 ticks by the <a href="#amz">Lx200</a> <a href="#dt1">dependent conduit</a> that
follows the initial <a href="#fzn">syringe</a> converter. The design is

<p>The MWSSes are converted to <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>, which produce a standard

        <div class="block">
          <h2>oscillator</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Any pattern that is a <a href="#mgk">predecessor</a> of itself. The term
is usually restricted to non-<a href="#qup">stable</a> finite patterns; period 1
oscillators are <a href="#qup">stable</a> and are usually just called <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a>.
The <a href="#i1p">blinker</a> is the smallest non-stable oscillator, having period 2.
There are oscillators of almost all higher periods (see
<a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>). In general <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> theory the term
"oscillator" usually covers <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> as well, but this usage is
not normal in Life.
<p>Oscillators consisting of separate objects which do not react in
any phase are usually ignored. For example, a separated <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>
and <a href="#sj5">pulsar</a> makes a period 6 oscillator, but is considered
<a href="#xdg">trivial</a>.
<p>An oscillator can be divided into a <a href="#mfj">rotor</a> and a <a href="#vf6">stator</a>, and the
stator can be further subdivided into <a href="#b95">bushing</a> and <a href="#io3">casing</a>. Some
oscillators have no casing cells, and a few 100%-<a href="#sqn">volatility</a>
oscillators also have no bushing cells.
<p>An oscillator can be constructed from any <a href="#xtd">gun</a> as long as <a href="#v1v">eaters</a>
can be added to consume its output. If it is a <a href="#w43">true</a> <a href="#xtd">gun</a> then the
period of the oscillator will be the same as the gun - unless the
eating mechanism multiplies the period, as in the case of gliders
caught by a <a href="#u19">boat-bit</a>.
<p>With the discovery of <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a>, <a href="#lqz">relays</a> provide an easy way to
create oscillators of all large periods. For example, eight gliders
travelling in a loop created by four <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a> can create any period
above 42, with a population never exceeding 356 live cells.
<p>For the very lowest periods, whole families of <a href="#dwr">extensible</a>
oscillators are known. Examples of this are <a href="#uwc">barberpole</a>, <a href="#r0a">cross</a>,
<a href="#p8a">pentoad</a>, <a href="#r2w">p6 shuttle</a>, <a href="#bia">snacker</a>, and <a href="#ytp">multiple roteightors</a>. Any
of the <a href="#nxo">shuttles</a> are oscillators by definition, for example the
<a href="#th5">queen bee shuttle</a>. Many of these are also extensible. Other
oscillators such as <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> and <a href="#cig">tumbler</a> have unique mechanisms
that are not part of an extended family.
<p>Some oscillators are useful because of the <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> they can
cause to other objects. This is especially true if they provide a
<a href="#eh8">spark</a> on their boundary. Some oscillators are explicitly found by
<a href="#reu">search programs</a> in order to produce these sparks, such as
<a href="#svd">pipsquirters</a>.
<p>Some higher period oscillators have been found while running random
<a href="#dnq">soups</a>. This is especially true if the soup is run on a cylindrical
or torus <a href="#hfc">universe</a>. Sometimes the found objects can be moved to the
normal universe and supported there by added <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>.
<a href="#v31">Achim's p144</a> is an example.

<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a> construction. To be a good candidate for building
one of these types of patterns with a new period or speed, a

<a href="#j4d">signals</a>, strictly greater than the number of input signals required

          <p>A <a href="#w43">true</a> period 256 four-barrelled <a href="#y7q">glider gun</a> found by
Dave Buckingham in September 1995. It uses four <a href="#s7l">R64</a> <a href="#u15">conduits</a> to
make the second smallest known <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a> (after the
<a href="#iwj">Simkin glider gun</a>). The p256 gun was an early "teaser" from Dave

Either <a href="#v1v">eaters</a> or <a href="#kl1">snakes</a> can be added as shown above, to suppress
three of the glider streams so that only one stream escapes. This
gun's p256 glider stream is well-suited for repeated reactions with

<p>Running a partial result works for a few generations until the

the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired <a href="#eh8">spark</a> or

that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.
<p>Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance
that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is
no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a
base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search
area, or splitting the object into multiple <a href="#fas">arms</a> might result in
finding a complete working object.

          <p>For <a href="#tka">circuit</a> mechanisms, "periodic" is the opposite of <a href="#if5">p1</a>
or <a href="#qup">stable</a>. Periodic <a href="#tka">circuits</a> necessarily contain <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>,
and therefore they can generally only accept input <a href="#j4d">signals</a> that are
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> to the combined <a href="#ve5">period</a> of those oscillators (but see
<a href="#ama">universal regulator</a>).
<p>For <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#goz">streams</a>, "periodic" means that signals will only be
present in the stream at one out of every <i>n</i> ticks, where <i>n</i> is the
<a href="#ve5">period</a> of the stream. In a periodic <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> there
may be gaps, so that signals do not always appear at every nth tick.
However, if a signal does appear, its distance measured in ticks from
previous and future signals will always be an exact multiple of <i>n</i>.

          <p>A term commonly used for a <a href="#xge">pulse divider</a>, because
dividing the number of <a href="#j4d">signals</a> in a regular stream by <i>N</i> necessarily
multiplies the <a href="#ve5">period</a> by <i>N</i>. The term "period multiplier" can be
somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can
accept input streams that are not strictly <a href="#we8">periodic</a>.
<p>Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple
the output of some <a href="#fnm">rakes</a> to create high-period rakes in a
relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a
linear increase in size).
<p>For <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> signals and <a href="#y7q">glider guns</a>, a number of small period
doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example,
the following <a href="#u15">conduit</a> produces one output glider after accepting
four input <a href="#saf">B-heptominoes</a>, or four Herschels if a conduit such as

the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes

<p>The following pattern demonstrates a p4 <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> found by
Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a

to delete a glider wave produced by a <a href="#fnm">rake</a> whose period is 2 (mod

<p>Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of

Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000,
Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix.
The situation for higher periods is unknown.
<p>An easy <a href="#or5">synthesis</a> of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as

unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive

          <p>A series of patterns by Paul Tooke in 2010, based on
a simplification and extension of the <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship's
construction mechanism. Tooke produced a number of
slow-salvo-constructed patterns with <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>, including
a series of breeder patterns of previously unknown types. For some
patterns, the Gemini's two <a href="#bwp">construction arms</a> were moved to a
permanent stationary platform, using fourteen glider-loop channels
instead of twelve.
<p>Some of these breeder patterns remain difficult to classify
unambiguously. For example, one pattern was designed to be an MSS
breeder - a modified <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship puffing <a href="#q3g">slide guns</a> which
build lines of <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>. However, the slide guns produce both moving
and stationary objects at a linear rate, because streams of gliders
are needed to reach out to the construction zone to do the <a href="#gh5">push</a>
reaction and build more blocks. The pattern could therefore be
classified as a hybrid MSM/MSS breeder. Other breeder patterns
utilizing slide guns and <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> technology are
likely to cause similar classification ambiguities.

          <p>A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The
mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb in
1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular
automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes, this
being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of
different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved by
hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special
significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early
years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced
the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes" the
plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have
followed Golomb in using the longer form.)
<p>It is possible for a polyomino to be an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a>. In fact
there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the
<a href="#r0a">cross</a> and its larger analogues. The only other known examples are
the <a href="#dp5">block</a>, the <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>, the <a href="#y3s">toad</a>, the <a href="#n70">star</a> and (in two
different phases) the <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a>.
<p>A polyomino can also be a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, as the <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> and

the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur in just 14

p28 and p29 oscillators. The pre-pulsar was also a vital component
of the first known p26 and p47 oscillators.

spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship
such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as
the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a
high-period puffer for the new speed.
<p>As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known
velocity of <a href="#abo">elementary</a> spaceship, except for <i>c</i>/6 and <i>c</i>/7 diagonal
and (2,1)<i>c</i>/6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>, simply by removing some part of the trailing
cleanup mechanism.

enough to be easily synthesized with gliders.

and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will
not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original
position. The relatively small size and low period of this example
made it useful for constructing compact glider <a href="#xtd">guns</a> of certain

<p>Other arrangements don't create any lasting output, but create

          <p>Any Herschel track-based gun with a period below 62, which is
the lowest period with a stable glider-emitting conduit. This was
Dieter Leithner's name for the <a href="#w43">true</a> p54 glider gun he built in
January 1998 - a short form of <a href="#t82">Quetzalcoatlus</a>, which expresses the
fact that the gun was a very large <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a> that was not an
<a href="#ipa">emu</a>. Shortly afterwards Leithner also built a p56 Quetzal using a
mechanism found by Noam Elkies for this purpose. In October 1998
Stephen Silver constructed a p55 Quetzal using Elkies' p5 <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>
of the previous month. Quetzals of periods 57-61 have since been
constructed.
<p>Some of the more recent Quetzals are not Herschel loops, but are
instead short Herschel tracks firing several glider streams all but
one of which is reflected back to the beginning of the track to
create a new Herschel. Noam Elkies first had the idea of doing this
for the p55 case, and Stephen Silver constructed the resulting gun
shortly after building the original (much larger) p55 Quetzal. Jason
Summers later built a p54 version, which is more complicated because
the evenness of the period makes the timing problems considerably
more difficult.

          <p>Any <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> whose debris consists of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>. A rake is
said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction
of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally
the term "rake" was applied only to forwards <i>c</i>/2 glider puffers (see
<a href="#af3">space rake</a>). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case
where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the
puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region
of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers
cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a
<a href="#xtd">gun</a>).
<p>Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were <i>c</i>/2, rakes of other
velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of
<a href="#we6">Corderships</a> in 1991 made it easy for <i>c</i>/12 diagonal rakes to be
built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time
David Bell had constructed <i>c</i>/3 and <i>c</i>/5 rakes (May 1996 and September
1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2<i>c</i>/5 rake in June
2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a <i>c</i>/4
orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found by
David Bell).
<p>The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this
could be achieved by a 3<i>c</i>/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The
smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers' <a href="#cn0">backrake</a>,
March 2001).

useful conduit. For example, the <a href="#wvr">Snark</a>'s very low recovery time
allowed for the creation of <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> with previously unknown
<a href="#ve5">periods</a>, 43 and 53.
<p>For the most part this is a synonym for <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a>. However,
<a href="#ds9">overclocking</a> a complex circuit can often allow it to be used at a
<a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> much lower than its safe recovery time.

          <p>A <a href="#uxc">toolkit</a> developed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015,
which enables the construction of patterns with population growth
that asymptotically matches an infinite number of different

<p>Sublinear functions are possible using the recursive-filter toolkit
as well. It can be used to construct a glider-emitting pattern with
a slowness rate <i>S</i>(<i>t</i>) = O(log***...*(<i>t</i>)), the nth-level iterated

          <h2>reflector</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Any <a href="#qup">stable</a> or oscillating pattern that can reflect some
type of <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> (usually a <a href="#p9q">glider</a>) without suffering permanent
damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection
process is generally called a <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a> instead.
<p>The first known reflector was the <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a>, which functions
as a 180-degree glider reflector (see <a href="#lqz">relay</a>). Other examples
include the <a href="#xgx">buckaroo</a>, the <a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a> and some oscillators
based on the <a href="#z87">traffic jam</a> reaction. Glider <a href="#xtd">guns</a> can also be made
into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.
<p>In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider
reflectors, with <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> supplying the required <a href="#sjt">domino</a>
<a href="#eh8">sparks</a> at different periods. A <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> produced a <a href="#ori">p8 bouncer</a>,
and a <a href="#d06">p6 pipsquirter</a> produced an equivalent <a href="#y31">p6 bouncer</a>. A more
complicated construction allows a <a href="#q3y">p5 bouncer</a> (which, as had been
anticipated, soon led to a <a href="#w43">true</a> p55 <a href="#wls">Quetzal</a> gun). And in August
1999 Elkies found a suitable <a href="#uyk">sparker</a> to produce a <a href="#gsf">p7 bouncer</a>,
allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.
<p>These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc.,
until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and
simple reaction, the <a href="#onm">bumper</a>, starting with a <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> as <a href="#i1x">bait</a>
instead of a <a href="#i0n">boat</a>. This resulted in a series of periodic
<a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a> reflectors, whereas Elkies' <a href="#uxt">bouncer</a> reflectors
are all <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a>. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer"
contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P
and is colour-preserving.
<p>Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain
conditions they can be used to construct <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of all
sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable
reflectors were possible (see <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>), but no one
was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so
in October 1996.
<p>Callahan's original reflector has a <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> of 4840, soon
improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean
Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave
Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different
method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a
method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced
this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by
Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.
<p>In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with
a repeat time of only 202 (see <a href="#kgq">boojum reflector</a>). This reflector
won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the
prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree
reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a>
<a href="#wvr">Snark</a> reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable
reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100
prize for a <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> stable reflector contained within a 25
by 25 <a href="#p6q">bounding box</a>, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.
<p>As of June 2018, the following <a href="#s1s">splitter</a> is among the smallest
known 90-degree <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a>. The top output can
be blocked off by an <a href="#v1v">eater</a> if needed. For small 180-degree
colour-changing reflectors see <a href="#h8b">rectifier</a>, and also the sample
pattern in <a href="#s1s">splitter</a>.

<p>With the correct placement of the faraway object, the complete
pattern is theoretically capable of building any glider-constructible
object. This means that 43 is the maximum number of gliders required
to build any constructible object, no matter what size. However, it
is not possible to determine in practice what the locations of these
43 gliders should be, even for a relatively simple construction.

to a specific ASCII encoding used for patterns in Conway's Life and
other similar cellular automata. This encoding was introduced by
Dave Buckingham and is now the usual means of exchanging relatively
small patterns by email or in online forum discussions.
<p>As an example of the rle format, here is a representation of the
<a href="#mp9">Gosper glider gun</a>. The "run lengths" are the numbers, b's are dead
cells, o's are live cells, and dollar signs signal new lines:

<a href="#t6w">period doubler</a>. Connecting it to the initial stage of the L156

<a href="#s1s">splitter</a>, or as a quasi-<a href="#he2">edge shooter</a> after suppressing the
additional glider output:

The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun
collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where <a href="#fzn">syringes</a>
can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion
reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another
glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the

At generation 774, an R-pentomino produces a <a href="#sxo">queen bee</a> which lasts
17 more generations before being destroyed, enough time for it to
flip over. This observation led to the discovery of the
<a href="#mp9">Gosper glider gun</a>.

partitioned into no more than four salvos. Compare <a href="#w4e">flotilla</a>. In
contrast with a <a href="#lx2">convoy</a>, the spaceships in a salvo are usually

<p>Salvos may be <a href="#gpd">slow</a> or <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a>. The following partially

The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the
second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown.
The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it
will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many <a href="#fyw">ticks</a> it is
delayed. The <a href="#qtm">slow glider construction</a> entry includes an example of

          <p>A computer program or script that automates the search

because the difficulty of finding previously unknown Life objects now
commonly exceeds the patience, speed, and accuracy of humans.
Various types of search programs are used for finding objects such as
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>, <a href="#v8p">drifters</a>, <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>, <a href="#dnq">soups</a>,
<a href="#h4h">Gardens of Eden</a>, and <a href="#rti">slow salvos</a>.
<p>Some search programs generate <a href="#p65">partial results</a> as they are
running, so even if they don't complete successfully, something of
use might still be salvaged from the run.
<p>Example search programs are <a href="#hkm">dr</a>, <a href="#tm4">lifesrc</a>, <a href="#ojz">gfind</a>, and
<a href="#dmj">Bellman</a>.
<p>There are other types of programs which don't perform searches as
such, but instead perform large constructions. These are used to
correctly complete very complicated objects such as the
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a>, <a href="#vke">Gemini</a>, <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>, and

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Movement of information through the Life universe. Signals
can be carried by <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, <a href="#odj">fuses</a>, <a href="#v8p">drifters</a>, or <a href="#u15">conduits</a>.
Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the spaceship,
while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the
<a href="#ups">speed of light</a>.
<p>In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence of
a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> or other spaceship at a particular point at a particular
time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of gliders to
form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Signals can be
duplicated using <a href="#pzu">glider duplicators</a> or other <a href="#iwu">fanout</a> devices, and
can be used up by causing <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> on other parts of the Life
object.
<p>Signals are used in <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> circuitry,
<a href="#eub">universal constructors</a>, <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>, and other computational
patterns such as the <a href="#sd7">pi calculator</a> and <a href="#sy8">Osqrtlogt</a> patterns.

input. This term is commonly used only for signal <a href="#wel">wires</a>,
particularly <a href="#aip">2c/3</a> signals. A <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> could reasonably be called a
"glider elbow", but <a href="#vwv">glider reflector</a> is the standard term. A
signal elbow with a <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> less than 20 ticks would enable a
trivial proof that Conway's Life is <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>.
<p>A near miss is the following elbow-like <a href="#gra">converter</a> found by Dean
Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2<i>c</i>/3 signal by 90 degrees, but
unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process.
This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended
(e.g., to make a closed loop).

<p>Relatively small <a href="#df5">composite</a> <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> elbows can now be constructed,
using Tanner Jacobi's 2015 discovery of a small <a href="#rhe">H-to-MWSS</a>
component. For example, the <a href="#gy6">Orthogonoid</a> includes a
constructor/reflector that reflects an MWSS stream by 180 degrees,
but it can be trivially reconfigured to make a 90-degree MWSS elbow.

        <div class="block">
          <h2>single-channel</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A type of <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> discovered and
developed by Simon Ekstr&ouml;m and others starting in December 2015. The
initial <a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> toolkit was near-minimal, with just one
<a href="#gh5">push</a>, one <a href="#fye">pull</a>, and one output glider of each colour (see
<a href="#c9m">colour of a glider</a>). Later searches produced a much larger and
more efficient library.
<p>Single-channel <a href="#o36">recipes</a> consist of a <a href="#goz">stream</a> of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> on a
single <a href="#aii">lane</a> and aimed at a <a href="#igh">construction elbow</a>, usually separated
from each other by at least 90 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>. In spite of these strict
limitations, single-channel recipes can be made to do surprising
things. For example, it is possible to build a <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> directly on
the <a href="#mfc">construction lane</a> of an active construction arm, starting from
a single <a href="#g91">elbow</a> <a href="#dp5">block</a>. This can allow the arm to reach
efficiently around complex obstructions by bending itself through
multiple <a href="#og5">lossless elbows</a>. Known recipes can also remove an elbow
when it is no longer needed, by controlled demolition of the Snark.
<p>As of June 2018, almost all single-channel recipes are made up of
<a href="#ac3">singletons</a> and <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> pairs of gliders, but no synchronized
triplets or larger groups. This is not an inherent limitation of
single-channel construction, but rather a limitation in the
<a href="#reu">search program</a> used to find currently known single-channel
<a href="#uxc">toolkits</a>.
<p>A useful byproduct of this limitation is that single-channel
recipes can be trivially adjusted to allow them to safely cross
perpendicular data streams, including other single-channel recipes
(or earlier parts of the same recipe). To avoid collisions with a
crossing stream, each singleton glider or glider pair can safely be
delayed by any even number of ticks, or technically by any multiple
of the period of the current <a href="#hyb">intermediate target</a>. The final result
of the construction will not be affected.

          <p>A <a href="#xtd">gun</a> which fires sideways from an extending arm. The
arm consists of streams of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> which are pushing a pattern
away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every
time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a
different path.
<p>Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994
(although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following
pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders
shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the
length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an
output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide
guns using other reactions.)

          <h2>sliding block memory</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A memory register whose value is stored as the
position of a <a href="#dp5">block</a>. The block can be moved by means of <a href="#p9q">glider</a>
collisions. See <a href="#smz">block pusher</a> for an example.
<p>In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the
existence of a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a> in Life) two gliders were used to
pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and
thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.

<p>Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to
pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push
it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to
be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It
suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway
did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as
Hickerson did).
<p>Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's
<a href="#qu4">URM</a>, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex
constructions, such as David Bell's <a href="#i3k">Collatz 5N+1 simulator</a> and Adam

          <p>Construction an object by a "slow salvo" of
<a href="#p9q">gliders</a> all coming from the same direction, in such a way that
timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too
close behind one another. This type of construction requires an
initial seed object, such as a <a href="#dp5">block</a>, which is modified by each
glider in turn until the desired object is produced.
<p>In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a
block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53
gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of
<a href="#v06">sparse Life</a>, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the
first few generations collide with <a href="#eis">blonks</a> and other debris.
<p>Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for
<a href="#eub">universal constructors</a>. However, in this case the above definition
is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow
constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have
a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much
greater flexibility, as <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a> can now be freely used in the
intermediate construction steps. The <a href="#iup">Snarkmaker</a> is a very large p2
slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following <a href="#tqi">edgy</a>
construction of an <a href="#uic">eater1</a> starting from a block.

by Hartmut Holzwart, following a suggestion by Alan Hensel. The

The word "spacefiller" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon
became the accepted term.

<p>It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all rational

examples travelled at <i>c</i>/4 diagonally (gliders) or <i>c</i>/2 orthogonally
(everything else).
<p>In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated searches to look
for new <a href="#abo">elementary</a> spaceships, and had considerable success. Other
people have continued these searches using tools such as <a href="#tm4">lifesrc</a>
and <a href="#ojz">gfind</a>, and as a result we now have a great variety of
elementary spaceships travelling at sixteen different velocities.
The following table details the discovery of elementary spaceships
with new velocities as of July 2018.

<p>Several infinite families of adjustable-velocity <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>
have also been constructed, of which the first was Gabriel Nivasch's
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> from December 2004. The macro-spaceship with the
widest range of possible speeds is Michael Simkin's <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>
from April 2016; in theory it supports any rational orthogonal speed
strictly less than <i>c</i>&lt;4. A somewhat similar design supporting any
rational speed strictly less than <i>c</i>/2 has been shown to be feasible,
but as of July 2018 no explicit examples have been constructed.
<p>A period <i>p</i> spaceship that displaces itself (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) during its period,
where <i>m</i>&gt;=<i>n</i>, is said to be of type (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i>. It was proved by Conway
in 1970 that <i>p</i>&gt;=2<i>m</i>+2<i>n</i>. (This follows immediately from the
easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate
greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)

1998 by Dean Hickerson using his <a href="#hkm">dr</a> <a href="#reu">search program</a>, shown below
to the left and right respectively. These both absorb <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> as a
standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>
at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders
with different phases as shown.

The above mechanisms can be used to build <a href="#vq5">intermitting glider guns</a>.
The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider
impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't
be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten
ticks after impact, which allows p4<i>N</i> guns to be used.
<p>The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform
other <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> "around the corner" of some objects. For
example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a
row of ten <a href="#gub">AK47 reactions</a> to form a much smaller period 94 glider
gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the

          <p>A single <a href="#i53">switch engine</a> which survives
indefinitely by interacting with the appropriate <a href="#csj">exhaust</a> such that
it prevents the engine from ever being destroyed.
<p>The only known types of stabilized switch engines were found by
Charles Corderman soon after he discovered the switch engine itself.
There is a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and
the p384 glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most
<a href="#tve">natural</a> infinite growth patterns in Life. As of June 2018 they are
the basis for every infinite growth pattern ever seen to occur from a
random asymmetric <a href="#dnq">soup</a>, even after trillions of <a href="#y9n">census</a> results by
<a href="#uj4">apgsearch</a> and similar projects.
<p>Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen
under <a href="#rku">infinite growth</a>, and one giving rise to a glider-producing
switch engine is shown under <a href="#xop">time bomb</a>.
<p>Here is the block-laying type showing its distinctive zig-zag trail
of blocks.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A multi-stage <a href="#gra">converter</a> constructed by
Dave Greene in January 2007, using a complex recipe found by Noam
Elkies to insert a signal into a <a href="#nuk">2c/3 wire</a>. The wire's high
transmission speed allows a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> from a <a href="#m17">highway robber</a> to catch
up to a <a href="#i1v">salvo</a> of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>. Ultimately the mechanism restores the
key glider, which was destroyed by the highway robber in the first
stage of the converter, to its exact original position in the salvo.
<p>Much smaller stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices have since been
designed that use simple 0-degree glider <a href="#fnr">seed</a> <a href="#th3">constellations</a>
instead of a 2<i>c</i>/3 wire.
<p>These patterns are labeled "pseudo-Heisenburp", because a true
<a href="#ozg">Heisenburp device</a> does not even temporarily damage or affect a
passing glider, yet can still produce an output <a href="#j4d">signal</a> in response.
However, it is impossible to construct a <a href="#qup">stable</a> device that can
accomplish this for gliders. True stable Heisenburp devices are
possible with many other types of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, but not with gliders
which have no usable side <a href="#eh8">sparks</a> to initiate an output signal.

          <h2>staged recovery</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A type of signal-processing <a href="#tka">circuit</a> where the
initial reaction between <a href="#k63">catalysts</a> an incoming signal results in an
imperfect recovery. A catalyst is damaged, destroyed completely as
in a <a href="#i1x">bait</a> reaction, or one or more objects are left behind that
must be cleaned up before the circuit can be reused. In any of these
three cases, output signals from the circuit must be used to complete
the cleanup. In theory the cleanup process might itself be <a href="#yx7">dirty</a>,
requiring additional cleanup stages. In rare cases this might
theoretically allow the construction of special-purpose circuits with
a lower <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> than would otherwise be possible, but in
practice this kind of situation does not commonly arise.
<p>An example is the record-breaking (at the time) 487-tick reflector
constructed by Adam P. Goucher on 12 April 2009. 487 ticks was a
slight improvement over the repeat time of the <a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a>.
The reflector featured a standard <a href="#ogp">Callahan G-to-H</a>, with cleanup by
an internal <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> glider reflector found by Dieter Leithner many
years before. This in turn was cleaned up by the usual ungainly
Herschel plumbing attached to the G-to-H's output. The dirty glider
reflector is not actually fully recovered before a second p487 signal
enters the full reflector. However, it has been repaired by the time
the internal reflector is actually needed again, so the cycle can be
successfully repeated at p487 instead of p497.

<p>Many stamp collections contain "fonts" made of single cells (which
cleanly die) to annotate the objects or to draw boxes around them.
For example, here is a stamp collection which shows all the ways that
two gliders can create a <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> or an <a href="#v1v">eater</a>:

<p>Alternatively, stamp collections can use <a href="#acg">LifeHistory</a> for their
annotations, but this requires a more sophisticated Life program to
handle. Numbers, or more rarely letters, are sometimes constructed
from stable components such as <a href="#dp5">blocks</a> or <a href="#kl1">snakes</a>, but their
readability is somewhat limited by placement constraints.

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Any <a href="#qup">stable</a> pattern, usually assumed to be finite and
nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this
definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair
of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be
an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.
<p>For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a
stable pattern as a <a href="#rxv">strict still life</a> only if its <a href="#yrz">islands</a> cannot
be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in
their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can
be referred to as a <a href="#th3">constellation</a>. If its cells form a single
<a href="#tsb">cluster</a> it is also, more specifically, either a <a href="#sma">pseudo still life</a>
or a <a href="#epc">quasi still life</a>.
<p>In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be
divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into
two. See the 32-bit <a href="#f6b">triple pseudo</a> (32 bits) and the 34-bit
<a href="#a9e">quad pseudo</a> for examples.
<p>All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be
<a href="#ciy">glider constructible</a>. It is an open question whether all still
lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For
a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially
useful in <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> circuitry, see also <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>.
<p>The smallest still life is the <a href="#dp5">block</a>. Arbitrarily large still
lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a <a href="#paf">canoe</a> or
<a href="#lq1">barge</a>. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can
be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of <a href="#wss">zebra stripes</a> or
<a href="#ymr">chicken wire</a>, among many other options. See <a href="#b8s">density</a> for more
precise limits.

a secondary input signal. This can be used either as a memory device
storing one bit of information, or as a simple delay mechanism. In
the following January 2016 example by Martin Grant, a
<a href="#t1k">ghost Herschel</a> marks the output signal location, and a "ghost
<a href="#ktx">beehive</a>" marks the location of the intermediate still life.

The <a href="#uic">eater1</a> in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if

          <h2>superstring</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one
side so that it moves at the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>, often leaving debris
behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald
and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by
Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many
different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen
Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)
<p>Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run
between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a <a href="#odj">fuse</a> which can be
made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony
Smithurst and uses <a href="#r3y">tubs</a>. (This is shown below. The superstring
itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one
blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the
track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be
used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this
example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track
consisting of <a href="#i0n">boats</a>. At present these are the only two waveguides
known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It
would be interesting to find one that remains intact.
<p>See <a href="#s35">titanic toroidal traveler</a> for another example of a
superstring.

          <p>A <a href="#j4d">signal</a>-carrying <a href="#tka">circuit</a> that can send output signals to
two or more different locations, depending on the state of the
mechanism. These may be <a href="#on7">toggle circuits</a>, where the state of the
switch changes after each use, or <a href="#j70">permanent switches</a> that retain
the same state through many uses until a change is made with a
separate signal.
<p>More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it
can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the
following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by
Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an
incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby
block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/switch"><img src="/lexicon/pix/switch.png" width="526" height="328" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’switch’"></a></p>

<p>The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance
<a href="#fzn">syringe</a> variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not
technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
source can deliver the signal to the block <a href="#wle">factory</a> (the two
<a href="#uic">eater1s</a> on the right side of the pattern). Alternate <a href="#gra">converter</a>
mechanisms could also be used to place the block.
<p>An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism,
also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 <a href="#k3a">H-to-G</a>. See
also <a href="#f3j">bistable switch</a> for a very robust and versatile toggle switch

          <p>The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman
in 1971, which is a <a href="#u97">glide symmetric</a> unstable <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which moves
diagonally at a speed of <i>c</i>/12 (8 cells every 96 generations).

<p>The <a href="#csj">exhaust</a> is <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> and unfortunately catches up and destroys
the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found
several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce <a href="#u5t">puffers</a>,
using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See
<a href="#tlb">stabilized switch engine</a> and <a href="#faq">ark</a>.
<p>No <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> were able to be made from switch engines until Dean
Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see <a href="#we6">Cordership</a>).
Switch engine <a href="#m30">technology</a> is now well-advanced, producing many <i>c</i>/12
diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.
<p>Small <a href="#ml6">polyominoes</a> exist whose <a href="#t2z">evolution</a> results in a switch
engine. See <a href="#z1l">nonomino switch engine predecessor</a>.
<p>Several three-glider collisions produce <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> reactions that
produce a stabilized switch engine along with other <a href="#fdc">ash</a>, making
<a href="#rku">infinite growth</a>. Until recently the only known syntheses for
<a href="#nhx">clean</a> unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There
are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider
arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to,
making it easier to repeat the reaction:

Running the above for 20 ticks completes a <a href="#dyy">kickback</a> reaction with
the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine
recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.

          <h2>symmetric</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis
and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as
the <a href="#dp5">block</a>, <a href="#ktx">beehive</a>, <a href="#n2s">pond</a>, <a href="#a3s">loaf</a>, <a href="#kfr">clock</a>, and <a href="#i1p">blinker</a> are
symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are <a href="#jif">Kok's galaxy</a>,
<a href="#sjg">Achim's p16</a>, <a href="#r0a">cross</a>, <a href="#obt">Eureka</a>, and the <a href="#sj5">pulsar</a>.
<p>Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple
copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless
the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered
trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two <a href="#gr9">LWSSs</a>
travelling together a hundred cells apart).
<p>There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an
object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of
cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or
rows, and can have a <a href="#dz9">gutter</a>. Even symmetry occurs when the line of
reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects
with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.
<p>Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all
symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their <a href="#t2z">evolution</a>.
Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve,
but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single
object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two
gliders interact to form a <a href="#yw9">blockade</a>:
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/symmetric"><img src="/lexicon/pix/symmetric.png" width="152" height="75" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’symmetric’"></a></p>

<p>Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This
commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to
change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing
of new cells at their <a href="#dz9">gutter</a> interface. Examples of this are
<a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a>, <a href="#tih">centinal</a>, and the object shown in <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>.
Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric
object using nearby <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> in a symmetric
manner. Examples of this are <a href="#npa">Schick engine</a>, <a href="#sav">blinker ship</a>, and
<a href="#uml">hivenudger</a>.
<p>Many <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> found by <a href="#reu">search programs</a> are symmetric because
the search space for such objects is much smaller than for
non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include <a href="#c3c">dart</a>, <a href="#s22">60P5H2V0</a>, and
<a href="#gbh">119P4H1V0</a>.

          <p>An <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> found by Tanner Jacobi on 20
October 2017. This oscillator hassles an evolving <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a> to
produce an <a href="#mdd">phi</a> <a href="#eh8">spark</a>. The spark is very accessible and is able
to perturb many things.

The snakes can be replaced with eaters to form a slightly smaller
version, as shown in the p46 MWSS gun in <a href="#k51">gliderless</a>
<p>The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old
<a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a>, and so this is able to expand the known p46
<a href="#m30">technology</a>. For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a
Tanner's p46 and just one of the <a href="#k14">twin bees shuttles</a>.
<p>Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right
angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two
different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun. See
<a href="#vkg">p46 gun</a> and <a href="#k51">gliderless</a> for two of these. These are the first p46
guns found which do not use a twin bees shuttle at all.

<p>The transparent object is most often a very common <a href="#gt3">still life</a>

          <p>A trivial period-<i>N</i> oscillator is one in which every cell
oscillates at some smaller factor of <i>N</i>. See <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>. For
example, the joining of a period 3 and a period 4 <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> as
shown below creates a single object which is a trivial oscillator of
period 12.

However, there are trivial oscillators that meet this requirement,
but may still be considered to be <a href="#u4d">non-trivial</a> because the
different-period <a href="#mfj">rotors</a> are not separated by <a href="#vf6">stator</a> cells. An
example is Dean Hickerson's <a href="#jlc">trivial p6</a>. Conversely, there are
oscillators formed by trivial combinations of high-period <a href="#xtd">guns</a> or
<a href="#uyk">sparkers</a> that are only technically non-trivial, because the
lower-period components overlap but do not interact in any way.
<p>"Trivial" is also used to describe a <a href="#pve">parent</a> of an object which
has groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result,
such as isolated faraway cells. For example, here is a trivial
parent of a block.

oscillator. It is unusual because it has period-2 cells in contact
with period-3 cells.

          <p>An arrangement of four 90-degree <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a> that can
be placed into the path of a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> so as to delay it by an
adjustable number of generations, without changing its <a href="#aii">lane</a>. More
generally, any combination of <a href="#tka">circuits</a> may be referred to as a
trombone slide, if the grouping can be moved as a single unit that
functions as a 180-degree glider <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>.
<p>The smallest known trombone slides are made using <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a>. In the
trombone slide shown below, sample input and output gliders are
shown. The input glider will reach the same output location 128
generations sooner if the trombone slide is removed.
<p>If the top and left Snarks are moved together diagonally to the
upper left by <i>N</i> cells, then the glider delay is increased by 8<i>N</i>
generations since the glider has to travel <i>N</i> more cells in each
direction. This sliding action gives the trombone slide its name.
If only the final Snark is moved, then the output glider's path can
be altered by a number of full diagonals.

<p>Trombone slides made of the same type of component cannot alter the
glider path by half-diagonals, and can only change the timing by
multiples of 8 generations. For other timing changes, different
components are necessary. These may be stable like the
<a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a> or the <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> example shown in the
<a href="#vj8">reflector</a> article, or periodic like the various <a href="#onm">bumpers</a>.

single-glider <a href="#fnr">seed</a> (the term is seldom or never used in relation to
spaceships other than gliders). One-time turners may be 90-degree or
180-degree, or they may be 0-degree with the output in the same
direction as the input. A reusable turner would instead be called a
reflector. Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner
reactions that use common small <a href="#fdc">ash</a> objects: <a href="#i0n">boat</a>, <a href="#uic">eater1</a>,
<a href="#hzp">long boat</a>, and <a href="#y3s">toad</a>.
<p class="image"><a data-internal href="/lexicon/turner"><img src="/lexicon/pix/turner.png" width="636" height="449" loading="lazy" alt="Game of Life pattern ’turner’"></a></p>

<p>Of the reactions on the first row, the glider output is the same
<a href="#u3g">parity</a> for all but the long boat. The three still lifes are all
<a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a>, but the <a href="#y3s">toad</a> happens to be a <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a>
turner. The third row shows an <a href="#rs7">aircraft carrier</a> serving as a
"0-degree turner" that is also colour-changing.
<p>Three of the simplest 180-degree turners are shown in the second
row. The <a href="#qo7">Blockic</a> 180-degree turner is colour-preserving. The
<a href="#hzp">long boat</a> and <a href="#cgb">long ship</a> are again colour-changing; this is
somewhat counterintuitive as the output glider is on exactly the same
<a href="#aii">lane</a> as the input glider, but gliders travelling in opposite
directions on the same lane always have opposite colours.
<p>Many small one-time turner <a href="#th3">constellations</a> have also been
catalogued. The 90-degree two-block turner on the right, directly
below the toad, is also colour-changing but has the opposite parity.
<p>A one-time turner reaction can be used as part of a glider
<a href="#aob">injection</a> mechanism, or as a switching mechanism for a <a href="#j4d">signal</a>.
If a previous reaction has created the sacrificial object, then a
later glider is turned onto a new path. Otherwise it passes through
the area unaffected. This is one way to create simple switching
systems or logic <a href="#tka">circuits</a>. An example is shown in <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.

There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown
in the diagram. On the left is David Bell's <a href="#g11">double block reaction</a>
(which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on
the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method
produces the very large <a href="#hvu">twin bees shuttle spark</a> which is useful in
a number of ways. See <a href="#d7b">metamorphosis</a> for an example. Adding a
symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See

After 3 generations it becomes <a href="#coi">symmetric</a> along the horizontal axis,

          <p>A rectangular pattern, of size greater than 1&times;1, that
can simulate Life in the following sense. The pattern by itself
represents a dead Life cell, and some other pattern represents a live
Life cell. When the plane is tiled by these two patterns (which then
represent the state of a whole Life universe) they evolve, after a
fixed amount of time, into another tiling of the plane by the same
two patterns which correctly represents the Life generation following
the one they initially represented.
<p>It is usual to use the prefix "meta-" for simulated Life features,
so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell (constructed by
David Bell in January 1996), one metatick is 5760 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>, and one
<a href="#xis">metacell</a> is 500&times;500 cells. Capital letters were originally used to
make this distinction - e.g., Generation, Cell - but this usage is no
longer common.
<p>In December 2005, Jason Summers constructed an analogous unit cell
for Wolfram's Rule 110, a one-dimensional <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> that
is known be universal. See also <a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a>, <a href="#t7o">p1 megacell</a>.

          <h2>universal computer</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A computer that can compute anything that is
computable. (The concept of computability can be defined in terms of
Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number of
other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent
definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill Gosper
and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to construct a
universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove the universality
of a <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> with simple rules was in fact Conway's aim
in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof is outlined in
<a href="#uik">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="#xcz">The Recursive Universe</a>.
<p>Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in
practice In April 2000, Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine
construction (see <a href="http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm">http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm</a> for details).
This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of
a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.
But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction of a
universal computer, see
<a href="http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/">http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/</a>. This is a universal
register machine based around Dean Hickerson's
<a href="#nb4">sliding block memory</a>.
<p>In 2009 Adam P. Goucher constructed a programmable <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>
universal computer/constructor pattern using stable <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
circuitry. It included memory tapes and registers capable of holding
a simple universal instruction set and program data, and also a
minimal <a href="#x9k">single-arm</a> universal constructor. Its size meant that it
was extremely impractical to program it to be <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a>,
though this was theoretically possible if the escape of large numbers
of gliders could be allowed as a side effect.
<p>In February 2010, Paul Rendell completed a universal Turing machine
design with an unlimited tape, as described in his thesis at
<a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf">http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf</a>.
<p>In 2016 Nicolas Loizeau ("Coban") completed a Life pattern
emulating a complete 8-bit programmable computer.

          <h2>universal constructor</h2>
          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>A pattern that is capable of constructing
almost any pattern that has a <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>. This definition is
a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it is not
known, for example, whether all <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> are constructible. In
any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct
itself in order to qualify as such.
<p>An outline of Conway's proof that such a pattern exists can be
found in <a href="#uik">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="#xcz">The Recursive Universe</a>. The
key mechanism for the production of gliders with any given path and
timing is known as side-tracking, and is based on the
<a href="#ozb">kickback reaction</a>. A universal constructor designed in this way
can also function as a universal destructor: it can delete almost
any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.
<p>In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype
programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct
objects by means of <a href="#qtm">slow glider constructions</a>. It likely that it
could be programmed to construct itself, but the necessary program
would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would be needed
in order to copy the program.
<p>A universal constructor is theoretically most useful when attached
to a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a>, which can be programmed to control the
constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what
follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes
this computer.
<p>The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of
theoretical consequences.
<p>For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of
itself. This is a <a href="#dzz">replicator</a>.
<p>The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy of
itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself. This
would be a (very large, very high period) <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. Any
translation is possible, so that the spaceship could travel in any
direction. If the constructor makes a rotated but unreflected copy
of itself, the result would be a looping spaceship or
<a href="#ljz">reflectorless rotating oscillator</a>.
<p>The constructor could also travel slower than any given speed,
since we could program it to perform some time-wasting task (such as
repeatedly constructing and deleting a block) before copying itself.
Of course, we could also choose for it to leave some debris behind,
thus making a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>.
<p>It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal
constructor implies the existence of a <a href="#qup">stable</a> <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>. This
proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance
now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.
<p>Progressively smaller universal-constructor mechanisms without an
attached universal computer have been used in the
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a>, <a href="#yas">spiral growth</a> pattern, and the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a> and
<a href="#gy6">Orthogonoid</a>. See also <a href="#way">single-channel</a>.
<p>Another strange consequence of the existence of universal
constructors was pointed out by Adam P. Goucher and Tanner Jacobi in
2015. Any glider-constructible pattern, no matter how large, can be
constructed with a fixed number of gliders, by working out a
construction recipe for a universal constructor attached to a decoder
that measures the distance to a faraway object. The object's
position encodes a numeric value that can be processed to retrieve as
many bits of information as are needed to build a <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> to
construct any given target pattern. The simplest design, requiring
less than a hundred gliders, is described in <a href="#sh6">reverse caber tosser</a>.

aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject to
some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the
previous glider).
<p>Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March
2003. It is adjustable, so that the output can be aligned to any
desired period. A <a href="#qup">stable</a> universal regulator was constructed by
Dave Greene in September 2015, with a minimum delay between test
signals of 1177 ticks. Later stable versions have reduced the delay
to 952 ticks.
<p>A universal regulator can allow two complex <a href="#tka">circuits</a> to interact
safely, even if they have different base <a href="#ve5">periods</a>. For example,
signals from a <a href="#qup">stable</a> logic circuit could be processed by a

          <p>A <a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a> oblique
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a> constructed by Brett Berger on December 28, 2014.
It is currently the fastest oblique macro-spaceship in Conway's Game
of Life by several orders of magnitude, and is also the smallest
known oblique macro-spaceship in terms of bounding box, superseding
the <a href="#bf1">Parallel HBK</a>. It is no longer the smallest or fastest oblique
spaceship due to the discovery in 2018 of the <a href="#abo">elementary</a>
<a href="#nl7">knightship</a> <a href="#c8a">Sir Robin</a>.
<p>Previous oblique spaceships, the <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> and the
<a href="#c85">half-baked knightships</a>, are stationary throughout almost all of
their life cycles, as they construct the necessary mechanisms to
support a sudden short move. The waterbear constructs support for

<p>Also, the gliders or spaceships emitted by a rake may be referred
to as a wave, again because the line as a whole appears to move in a
different direction from the individual components, due to the rake's
movement. Compare with <a href="#goz">stream</a>.
<p>In general a wave can be interpreted as moving at a variety of
different velocities, depending on which specific subcomponents are
chosen as the starting and ending points for calculating speed and
direction. See <a href="#vsn">antstretcher</a>, <a href="#wsu">wavestretcher</a> for a practical

          <div class="meta"></div>
          <p>The set of cells on which a chosen cell or pattern
can potentially exert an influence in a given number of generations
<i>N</i>. If <i>N</i> is not specified it is generally taken to be one, in which
case the zone of influence simply coincides with the Moore
neighbourhood of the cell or pattern.
<p>The set for <i>N</i> generations consists of all the cells to which at
least <i>N</i> paths of length <i>N</i> can be traced from the cell(s) in question.
Contrast this with the range-<i>N</i> Moore neighbourhood, which consists of
all cells to which at least one path of length <i>n</i> can be traced.
