<h3 class="g">INTRODUCTION</h3>
This is a lexicon of terms relating to John Horton Conway's Game of Life.
An ASCII version and a multipage HTML version are also available.
This HTML version can be viewed either
<a href="lexiconf.htm" target="_top">with frames</a> or
<a href="lexicon.htm" target="_top">without frames</a>.
<p>This lexicon was originally compiled between 1997 and 2006 by
Stephen A. Silver, and was updated in 2016-18 by Dave Greene and David Bell.
See below for additional credits.

<p>The latest versions of this lexicon (both HTML and ASCII) should be available from the
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_home.htm" target="_top">
Life Lexicon Home Page</a>.
<h3 class="g">CREDITS</h3>
The largest single source for the early versions of this lexicon was a
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifep.zip" target="_top">glossary
compiled by Alan Hensel</a>
&#34;with indispensable help from John Conway, Dean Hickerson, David Bell,
Bill Gosper, Bob Wainwright, Noam Elkies, Nathan Thompson, Harold McIntosh,
and Dan Hoey&#34;.
<p>Other sources include the works listed in the
<a href="#bib">bibliography</a> at the
end of this lexicon, as well as pattern collections by
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifep.zip" target="_top">Alan Hensel</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/games/amusements/life/dblifelib-2.tgz" target="_top">David Bell</a>
(and especially Dean Hickerson's file <tt>stamp.l</tt> in the latter collection),
and the web sites of
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/mniemiec/lifepage.htm" target="_top">Mark Niemiec</a>,
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/" target="_top">Paul Callahan</a>,
<a href="http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/gol.html" target="_top">Achim Flammenkamp</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071112172439/http://members.aol.com/life1ine/life/lifepage.htm" target="_top">Robert Wainwright</a>
and
<a href="http://www.pentadecathlon.com/" target="_top">Heinrich Koenig</a>.
Recent releases also use a lot of information from Dean Hickerson's
header to his 1995
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/DRH/stamps.html" target="_top">stamp file</a>.
<p>Most of the information on recent results is from the discoverers
themselves, or from Nathaniel Johnston's excellent resources at
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/">http://www.conwaylife.com</a>, including both the <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki">LifeWiki</a> and the
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/forums">discussion forums</a>.
<p>The following people all provided useful comments on earlier releases
of this lexicon: David Bell, Nicolay Beluchenko, Johan Bontes, Scot
Ellison, Nick Gotts, Dave Greene, Alan Hensel, Dean Hickerson, Dieter
Leithner, Mark Niemiec, Gabriel Nivasch, Andrzej Okrasinski, Peter Rott,
Ken Takusagawa, Andrew Trevorrow, Malcolm Tyrrell, and the
conwaylife.com forum users with the handles 'thunk' and 'Apple Bottom'.
<p>The format, errors, use of British English and anything else you
might want to complain about are by Stephen Silver -- except that for
post-Version 25 definitions, everything besides the British English
may well be Dave Greene's fault instead.
<h3 class="g">COPYING</h3>
This lexicon is copyright &copy; Stephen Silver, 1997-2018. It may be
freely copied, modified and distributed under the terms of the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence (CC BY-SA 3.0),
as long as due credit is given.  This includes not just credit to those
who have contributed in some way to the present version (see above),
but also credit to those who have made any modifications.
<h3 class="g">LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDER</h3>
I have adopted the following convention: all characters (including spaces)
other than letters and digits are ignored for the purposes of ordering the
entries in this lexicon.
(Many terms are used by some people as a single word,
with or without a hyphen, and by others as two words.
My convention means that I do not have to list these in two separate places.
Indeed, I list them only once, choosing whichever form seems most
common or sensible.)
Digits lexicographically precede letters.
<h3 class="g">FORMAT</h3>
The main thing to note about the format of the HTML version is that
all keywords are preceded by a colon.  For example, entering <b>:foo</b> in
the dialogue box of your browser's Find command will take you straight
to the definition of the first word beginning with &#34;foo&#34;
(or at least it would if there were any).
This is the recommended way of finding a
particular definition when there is no link to click on.
<p>The diagrams in this lexicon are in a very standard format.
You should be able to simply copy a pattern, paste it into
a new file and run it in your favourite Life program.
If you use <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">
Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki's Golly</a>
then you can just paste the pattern directly into the Life program.
Diagrams are generally restricted to size 64&times;64 or less.
<p>Most definitions that have a diagram have also some data in brackets
after the keyword.
Oscillators are maked as p<i>n</i> (where <i>n</i> is a positive integer),
meaning that the period is <i>n</i> (p1 indicates a still life).
Wicks are marked in the same way but with the word &#34;wick&#34; added.
For spaceships the speed (as a fraction of <i>c</i>, the speed of light),
the direction and the period are given.
Fuses are marked with speed and period and have the word &#34;fuse&#34; added.
Wicks and fuses are infinite in extent and so have necessarily been
truncated, with the ends stabilized wherever practical.
<h3 class="g">SCOPE</h3>
This lexicon covers only Conway's Life,
and provides no information about other cellular automata.
David Bell has written articles on two other interesting cellular automata:
HighLife (which is similar to Life, but has a tiny replicator) and
Day &amp; Night (which is very different, but exhibits many of the same
phenomena).
These articles can be found on
<a href="http://tip.net.au/~dbell/" target="_top">his website</a>.
<h3 class="g">ERRORS AND OMISSIONS</h3>
If you find any errors (including typos) or serious omissions, then please
email b3s23life<img src="./at.gif" alt="@">gmail.com with the details.
As of August 2017 this email address is monitored by Dave Greene.
<h3 class="g">NAMES</h3>
When deciding whether to use full or abbreviated forms of forenames
I have tried, wherever possible, to follow the usage of the person concerned.
<h3 class="g">QUOTE</h3>
Every other author may aspire to praise;
the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Samuel Johnson, 1775</i>
<h3 class="g">DEDICATION</h3>
This lexicon is dedicated to the memory of Dieter Leithner,
who died on 26 February 1999.<hr>
<p>:<a name=nxn><b>0hd Demonoid</b></a> See <a href="#knq">Demonoid</a>.
<p>:<b>101</b> (p5) Found by Achim Flammenkamp in August 1994. The name was
suggested by Bill Gosper, noting that the <a href="#kv9">phase</a> shown below

1992 when Hartmut Holzwart discovered a larger spaceship, 163P4H1V0.

standard <a href="#dyy">kickback</a> that produces a clean output glider with no
leftover <a href="#fdc">ash</a>. The 180-degree change in direction is occasionally
useful in <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>, but is rarely used in <a href="#j4d">signal</a>
circuitry or in <a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a> patterns like the <a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> or
<a href="#qyv">Centipede</a>, because 90-degree collisions are generally much easier
to arrange.

two <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> to the northwest and southwest. As the diagram shows,
it is possible to substitute a loaf or other <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> for some
or all of the support gliders. This fact is used to advantage at the

until the discovery of <a href="#dqz">24-cell quadratic growth</a>. It superseded
<a href="#n2g">wedge</a>, which had held the record for eight years. See

January 2015.
<p>:<a name=nmn><b>25P3H1V0.2</b></a> (<i>c</i>/3 orthogonally, p3) A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> discovered by David
Bell in early 1992, with a minimum of 25 cells - the lowest number of
cells known for any <i>c</i>/3 spaceship. A note in
<a href="#e9z">Spaceships in Conway's Life</a> indicates that it was found with a
search that limited the number of live cells in each column, and
possibly also the maximum cross-section (4 cells in this case). See

<p>Each 2<i>c</i>/3 signal is made up of two half-signals that can be
separated from each other by an arbitrary number of <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>.
<p>Considerable effort has been spent on finding a way to turn a 2<i>c</i>/3
signal 90 or 180 degrees, since this would by one way to prove Life
to be <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>. There is a known 2<i>c</i>/3 converter shown under
<a href="#s9v">signal elbow</a>, which converts a standard 2<i>c</i>/3 signal into a
double-length signal. This is usable in some situations, but
unfortunately it fails when its input is a double-length signal, so
it can't be used to complete a loop.
<p>Noam Elkies discovered a glider synthesis of a reaction that can
repeatably insert a signal into the upper end of a 2<i>c</i>/3 wire. See
<a href="#r66">stable pseudo-Heisenburp</a> for details. On 11 September 2017, Martin
Grant reduced the input reaction to five gliders, or three gliders
plus a <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>. With the Herschel option the <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> is
152 ticks.

different ways, either at right angles, or else head-on. A large
number of the reactions cleanly destroy both gliders leaving nothing.
Many of the remaining reactions cleanly create some common objects,
and so are used as the first steps in <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a> or as part
of constructing interesting objects using <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>. Only a small
number of collisions can be considered <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> due to creating
multiple objects or a mess.
<p>Here is a list of the possible results along with how many
different ways they can occur (ignoring reflections and rotations).

Generator <a href="#dnq">soup</a> search script by Adam P. Goucher, for use with
Conway's Life and a wide variety of other rules. Development of the

soup shapes). Several customized variants of the Python script have
also been created by other programmers, to perform types of searches
not supported by Goucher's original apgsearch 1.&times;.
<p>All of these versions of the search utility work with a "haul" that
usually consists of many thousands or millions of random soup

Many known spaceships have multiple arms, usually fairly narrow.
This is an artefact of the search methods used to find such
spaceships, rather than an indication of what a "typical" spaceship
might look like.
<p>For an alternate meaning see <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a>.
<p>:<a name=vep><b>armless</b></a> A method of generating <a href="#rti">slow salvos</a> across a wide range of
lanes without using a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> with a movable <a href="#g91">elbow</a>.
Instead, streams of gliders on two fixed opposing <a href="#aii">lanes</a> collide
with each other to produce clean 90-degree output gliders. Slowing
down one of the streams by 8<i>N</i> ticks will move the output lanes of the
gliders toward the source of that stream by <i>N</i> <a href="#qcy">full diagonals</a>. This
construction method was used to create the supporting slow salvos in
the <a href="#c85">half-baked knightships</a>, and also in the <a href="#wfs">Parallel HBK gun</a>.
<p>:<a name=fdc><b>ash</b></a> The <a href="#qup">stable</a> or oscillating objects left behind when a chaotic
reaction stabilizes, or "burns out". Experiments show that for random
<a href="#dnq">soups</a> with moderate initial densities (say 0.25 to 0.5) the
resulting ash has a density of about 0.0287. (This is, of course,
based on what happens in finite fields. In infinite fields the
situation may conceivably be different in the long run because of the
effect of certain initially very rare objects such as <a href="#dzz">replicators</a>.)
<p>:<a name=xyl><b>asynchronous</b></a> Indicates that precise relative timing is not needed for
two or more input <a href="#j4d">signals</a> entering a <a href="#tka">circuit</a>, or two or more sets
of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> participating in a <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>. In some cases
the signals or sets of gliders can arrive in any order at all - i.e.,
they have non-overlapping effects.
<p>However, in some cases such as <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> constructions, there is
a required order for some of the incoming signals. These signals can
still be referred to as "asynchronous" because the number of ticks
between them is infinitely adjustable: arbitrarily long delays can
be added with no change to the final result. Compare <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a>.
<p>:<b>aVerage</b> (p5) Found by Dave Buckingham, 1973. The average number of
live <a href="#mfj">rotor</a> cells is five (V), which is also the period.

<a href="#mst">methuselah</a> that evolves into three <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>, two <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> and a

at generation 20 of the B-heptomino's evolution. B-heptominoes

<p>This pattern often arises with the cell at top left shifted one
space to the left, producing a seven-bit <a href="#l51">polyplet</a> that shares the
same eight-bit descendant but is not technically a heptomino at all.
This alternate form is shown as the input for <a href="#abo">elementary</a>
<a href="#gra">converter</a> patterns such as <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a> and <a href="#p6k">BRx46B</a>. This is standard
practice for elementary <a href="#u15">conduits</a>, since many of these conduits do
in fact produce this alternate form as output.
<p>The B-heptomino is considered a failed <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> or failed
<a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, since on its own it travels at <i>c</i>/2 for only a short time
before being affected by its own trailing debris. However, it can be
stabilized into a <i>c</i>/2 puffer or into a <a href="#nhx">clean</a> <i>c</i>/2 rake or spaceship.

<p>:<a name=f3j><b>bistable switch</b></a> A <a href="#ret">Spartan</a> <a href="#g5g">memory cell</a> found by Paul Callahan in
1994. It can be in one of two states, containing either a <a href="#i0n">boat</a> or
a <a href="#dp5">block</a>. Input gliders on the appropriate paths can change the boat
to a block, or vice-versa, while also emitting an output glider.
Unlike many memory cells, attempts to change the state to the one it
is already in are ignored with the glider passing through with no
reaction. This makes it easy to reset the memory cell to a known
state. Which of the two states is considered the SET and which
considered the RESET is just a matter of convention.
<p>The pattern below shows the "boat" state of the memory cell in its
original 1994 form. Two gliders are also shown to indicate the input
paths used to change the states. A smaller version is shown under
<a href="#vp1">century eater</a>, with the circuit in its "block" state.
<p>As shown, the rightmost glider changes the state from a boat to a
block and emits a glider to the upper right, while the leftmost
glider passes through unchanged. Alternatively, when the state
contains a block, then the leftmost glider changes the state from a
block to a boat, and emits a glider to the lower right, while the
rightmost glider passes through unchanged.

ways at a speed of <a href="#aip">2c/3</a> depending on the method used to ignite the
end of the row of blinkers. This variant has found the most use. The
burning advances 12 cells every 18 generations.

Fuses can also be made with blinker rows which contain occasional two

<p>:<a name=qm9><b>blinker puffer</b></a> Any <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> whose output is <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a>. However, the
term is particularly used for p8 <i>c</i>/2 puffers. The first such blinker
puffer was found by Robert Wainwright in 1984, and was unexpectedly
simple:

The importance of this larger blinker puffer (and others like it), is
that the engine which produces the blinker output is only p4. The
blinker row produced by the puffer can easily be ignited, and the
resulting <a href="#exg">blinker fuse</a> burns cleanly with a speed of 2<i>c</i>/3. When
the burning catches up to the engine, it causes a <a href="#op2">phase change</a> in
the puffer. This fact allows p8 blinker puffers to be used to
construct rakes of all periods which are large multiples of four.

generations 13 blinkers are created and 12 are destroyed, so the wick

A boat can be used as a 90-degree <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a>.
<p>:<a name=u19><b>boat-bit</b></a> A binary digit represented by the presence of a <a href="#i0n">boat</a> next
to a <a href="#kl1">snake</a> (or other suitable object, such as an
<a href="#rs7">aircraft carrier</a>). The bit can be toggled by a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> travelling
along a certain path. A correctly timed glider on a crossing path
can detect whether the transition was from 1 to 0 (in which case the
crossing glider is deleted) or from 0 to 1 (in which case it passes
unharmed). Three gliders therefore suffice for a
<a href="#i2f">non-destructive read</a>. The mechanisms involved are shown in the
diagram below. Here the bit is shown in state 0. It is about to be
set to 1 and then switched back to 0 again. The first crossing
glider will survive, but the second will be destroyed.

<p>In January 1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while
setting it to 0. A <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> is fired at the boat-bit. If it is
already 0 (absent) then the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1
(present) then the boat and the MWSS are destroyed and, with the help
of an <a href="#uic">eater1</a>, converted into a glider which travels back along
exactly the same path that is used by the gliders that toggle the
boat-bit.

<p>:<a name=q4w><b>breeder</b></a> Any pattern whose <a href="#n9e">population</a> grows at a quadratic rate,
although it is usual to exclude <a href="#yq2">spacefillers</a>. It is easy to see
that this is the fastest possible growth rate.
<p>The term is also sometimes used to mean specifically the breeder
created by Bill Gosper's group at MIT, which was the first known
pattern exhibiting <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>.
<p>There are four common types of breeder, known as MMM, MMS, MSM and
SMM (where M=moving and S=stationary). Typically an MMM breeder is a
<a href="#fnm">rake</a> <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>, an MMS breeder is a puffer producing puffers which
produce stationary objects (<a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> and/or <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>), an
MSM breeder is a <a href="#xtd">gun</a> puffer and an SMM breeder is a rake gun. There
are, however, less obvious variants of these types. Other less
common breeder categories (SSS, hybrid MSS/MSM, etc.) can be created
with some difficulty, based on <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> technology;
see <a href="#ylp">Pianola breeder</a>.
<p>The original breeder was of type MSM (a p64 puffer puffing p30
glider guns). The known breeder with the smallest initial population
is <a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a>.
<p>:<b>bridge</b> A term used in naming certain <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> (and the <a href="#vf6">stator</a>

which produces complex broken lines of gliders and blocks.

<p>:<a name=cb2><b>burn</b></a> A reaction which travels indefinitely as a <a href="#p5v">wave</a> through the
components of a <a href="#vac">wick</a> or an <a href="#dsi">agar</a>. A burning wick is known as a
<a href="#odj">fuse</a>.
<p>If the object being burned has a spatial periodicity, then the
active area of the burning usually remains bounded and so eventually
develops a periodicity too. It is unknown whether this will always
occur.
<p>The speed of burning can range from arbitrarily slow up to the
<a href="#ups">speed of light</a>. The results of burning can be clean (leaving no
debris), or leaving debris usually much different from the original
object. In rare cases, a <a href="#ekr">reburnable fuse</a> produces an exact copy of
the original object, allowing the creation of objects such as the
<a href="#mzy">telegraph</a>.
<p>In many useful cases burning can be initiated by impacting an
object with <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or other <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>. An object might be able
to burn in more than one way, depending on how the burn is initiated.

A <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a> can theoretically be configured to move at <i>c</i>/6,

<p>:<a name=cyv><b>c/7 spaceship</b></a> A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> travelling at one seventh of the

<p>:<b>CA</b> = <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a>
<p>:<a name=tyd><b>caber tosser</b></a> Any pattern whose <a href="#n9e">population</a> is asymptotic to <i>c</i>.log(<i>t</i>)
for some constant <i>c</i>, and which contains a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> (or other
<a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>) bouncing between a slower receding spaceship and a fixed
<a href="#vj8">reflector</a> which emits a spaceship (in addition to the reflected
one) whenever the bouncing spaceship hits it.
<p>As the receding spaceship gets further away the bouncing spaceship
takes longer to complete each cycle, and so the extra spaceships
emitted by the reflector are produced at increasingly large
intervals. More precisely, if <i>v</i> is the speed of the bouncing
spaceship and <i>u</i> the speed of the receding spaceship, then each
interval is (<i>v</i>+<i>u</i>)/(<i>v</i>-<i>u</i>) times as long as the previous one. The
population at time <i>t</i> is therefore <i>n</i>.log(<i>t</i>)/log((<i>v</i>+<i>u</i>)/(<i>v</i>-<i>u</i>)) + O(1),
where <i>n</i> is the population of one of the extra spaceships (assumed
constant).

<p>The catacryst consists of three <a href="#faq">arks</a> plus a glider-producing

<p>:<a name=x0g><b>Catagolue</b></a> An online database of objects in Conway's Game of Life and
similar cellular automata, set up by Adam P. Goucher in 2015 at
<a href="http://catagolue.appspot.com">http://catagolue.appspot.com</a>. It gathers data from a distributed
search of random initial configurations and records the eventual
decay products. Within a year of operation it had completed a
<a href="#y9n">census</a> of the <a href="#fdc">ash</a> objects from over two trillion asymmetric 16&times;16
<a href="#dnq">soups</a>. As of June 2018, well over two hundred trillion ash objects
have been counted, from over a trillion asymmetric soups.
<p>It is often possible to use Catagolue search results find
equivalent <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a> recipes for selected parts of
long-running active reactions. These random <a href="#dnq">soup</a> searches have
made it possible to find efficient construction methods for thousands

occasional <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. In many of these cases a

<p>:<a name=k63><b>catalyst</b></a> An object that participates in a reaction but emerges from

and <a href="#r3y">tub</a>. The still lifes and oscillators that form a <a href="#u15">conduit</a> are
examples of catalysts.
<p>A relatively rare form of catalysis occurs in a
<a href="#ra8">transparent debris effect</a>, where the catalyst in question is
completely destroyed and then rebuilt. The term is also sometimes
used for a modification of an active reaction in a <a href="#fnm">rake</a> by passing
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>.
<p>:<a name=j46><b>catch and throw</b></a> A <a href="#m30">technology</a> used (e.g., in the <a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a>) to
adjust the timing of a glider by turning it into a stationary object
using one interaction, and then later restoring it using a second
interaction. The interactions are caused by passing objects which

More generally, any oscillator which serves up a <a href="#lw3">bit</a> in the same
manner may be referred to as a caterer.
<p>:<a name=ni2><b>Caterloopillar</b></a> A family of adjustable-speed <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> constructed
by Michael Simkin in 2016, based on an "engineless caterpillar" idea
originally proposed by David Bell. The front and back halves of
Caterloopillars each function as universal constructors, with each
half constructing the building blocks of the other half, while also
reading and moving a construction tape. The overall design is
reminiscent of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Drawing Hands". The name
"Caterloopillar" is a reference to Douglas Hofstader's Strange Loop
concept.
<p>Simkin has written an automated script that can construct a
Caterloopillar for any rational speed strictly less than <i>c</i>/4, with
some exceptions. Speeds closer to the <i>c</i>/4 limit in general require
larger constructions, and for any given computer system it is easy to
choose a speed that makes it impractical to construct a
Caterloopillar.
<p>As of June 2018 one significant remaining exception is that
Caterloopillars with periods <i>c</i>/(6+4<i>N</i>) can't be constructed. This is
only a limitation of the current construction script, not of the
underlying Caterloopillar <a href="#uxc">toolkit</a>. For technical reasons, the
lowest speed that the current script can produce is around <i>c</i>/95. The
slowest Caterloopillars that have been explicitly constructed to date
are <i>c</i>/87 and <i>c</i>/92. These are among the smallest in terms of
population, though their bounding boxes are larger than some of the
higher-speed Caterloopillars.
<p>:<a name=dns><b>Caterpillar</b></a> A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> that works by laying tracks at its front
end. The first example constructed was a p270 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship built
by Gabriel Nivasch in December 2004, based on work by himself, Jason
Summers and David Bell. This Caterpillar has a population of about
12 million in each generation and was put together by a computer
program that Nivasch wrote. At the time it was by far the largest
and most complex Life object ever constructed, and it is still one of
the largest in terms of population.
<p>The 17<i>c</i>/45 Caterpillar is based on the following reaction between a
<a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a> and a <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>:
<pre>
	...............O
	O.............OO
	O............OO.
	O.............OO
	...............O
</pre>
In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45
generations, while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.
This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in
September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to
build a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which
pi-heptominoes crawling along two rows of blinkers interact to emit a
glider every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions
were later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic
idea of the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in
this way can be used to construct fleets of <a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a>
which convey gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they
can be used to build more blinkers.
<p>A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following
reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31
generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling
glider. In this case the tracks would be waves of backward-moving
gliders.

<p>:<a name=iq4><b>cell</b></a> The fundamental unit of space in the Life universe. The term is
often used to mean a live cell - the sense is usually clear from the
context.
<p>:<a name=u7f><b>cellular automaton</b></a> A certain class of mathematical objects of which
<a href="#mj0">Life</a> is an example. A cellular automaton consists of a number of
things. First there is a positive integer <i>n</i> which is the dimension
of the cellular automaton. Then there is a finite set of states <i>S</i>,
with at least two members. A state for the whole cellular automaton
is obtained by assigning an element of <i>S</i> to each point of the
<i>n</i>-dimensional lattice <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> (where <span class="b">Z</span> is the set of all integers). The
points of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> are usually called cells. The cellular automaton also
has the concept of a neighbourhood. The neighbourhood <i>N</i> of the
origin is some finite (nonempty) subset of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>. The neighbourhood of
any other cell is obtained in the obvious way by translating that of
the origin. Finally there is a transition rule, which is a function
from <i>S</i><sup><i>N</i></sup> to <i>S</i> (that is to say, for each possible state of the
neighbourhood the transition rule specifies some cell state). The
state of the cellular automaton evolves in discrete time, with the
state of each cell at time <i>t</i>+1 being determined by the state of its
neighbourhood at time <i>t</i>, in accordance with the transition rule.
<p>There are some variations on the above definition. It is common to
require that there be a quiescent state, that is, a state such that
if the whole universe is in that state at generation 0 then it will
remain so in generation 1. (In Life the OFF state is quiescent, but
the ON state is not.) Other variations allow spaces other than <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>,
neighbourhoods that vary over space and/or time, probabilistic or
other non-deterministic transition rules, etc.
<p>It is common for the neighbourhood of a cell to be the 3&times;...&times;3
(hyper)cube centred on that cell. (This includes those cases where
the neighbourhood might more naturally be thought of as a proper
subset of this cube.) This is known as the Moore neighbourhood.
<p>:<a name=y9n><b>census</b></a> A count of the number of different individual Life objects
within one larger object, most often the final <a href="#fdc">ash</a> of a random

<a href="#p9q">gliders</a>, and other common objects, as well as any rarer larger

many other Life-like rules, where even small objects can appear to
grow chaotically.
<p>It is possible that chaotic growth may occur rarely or even
regularly for large enough random Life objects, but if so the minimum
size of such patterns must be larger than what can currently be
experimentally simulated (but see <a href="#vyi">novelty generator</a>).
<p>In any case, it is not decidable whether a pattern that apparently

<p>In 2015 Chris Cain used this reaction to demonstrate conclusively
that any unidirectional glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>, no matter how large or
tightly packed, can be constructed by collisions between gliders that
are initially separated by any finite distance. As a corollary,
because all glider syntheses are made up of two to four
unidirectional salvos, any glider-constructible object has a
synthesis that starts with every glider at least <i>N</i> cells away from
every other glider (for any chosen <i>N</i>).

<p>The algorithm is simple. Starting with a number, if it is even

process is iterated a sequence of numbers is generated. When
starting with the value of 7, it is currently unknown whether or not
the sequence ever forms a cycle.
<p>Because of this the fate of the simulator is also currently
unknown. It may become stable, or become an oscillator with a high

All ON states behave the same for the purpose of applying the Life

<p>:<a name=c9m><b>colour of a glider</b></a> The colour of a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> is a property of the
glider that remains constant while the glider is moving along a

<a href="#vj8">reflector</a>. It is an important consideration when building
something using reflectors.
<p>The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First choose
some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered to be
white, and all other cells to be black or white in a checkerboard
pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) is white if <i>m</i>+<i>n</i> is
even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of a glider is the
colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase that can be rotated
to look like this:

<p>A reflector that does not change the colour of gliders obviously
cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than
it started on. But a 90-degree reflector that does change the colour
of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the resulting
glider will depend only on the direction of the glider, no matter how
many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility, therefore, both
types of reflector are required.
<p>Small periodic colour-changing glider reflectors (<a href="#uxt">bouncers</a>) are
known, and also small periodic colour-preserving glider reflectors
(<a href="#onm">bumpers</a>). Among stable patterns, only a small colour-preserving

<p>:<a name=th3><b>constellation</b></a> A general term for a group of two or more separate
objects, usually small still lifes and low-period oscillators.
Compare <a href="#sma">pseudo still life</a>.
<p>:<a name=bwp><b>construction arm</b></a> An adjustable mechanism in a <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>
that allows new objects to be constructed in any chosen location that
the arm can reach. A construction arm generally consists of a
<a href="#hir">shoulder</a> containing fixed guns or edge shooters, a movable
<a href="#igh">construction elbow</a> that slides forward and backward along the
<a href="#mfc">construction lane</a>(s), and in the case of <a href="#x9k">single-arm</a> universal
constructors, a <a href="#ns5">hand</a> target object at the construction site that
can be progressively modified by a <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> to produce each
desired object.
<p>:<a name=igh><b>construction elbow</b></a> One of the components of a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> in a
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>. The elbow usually consists of a single
<a href="#ret">Spartan</a> still life or small constellation. It accepts
<a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> recipes, in the form of <a href="#i1v">salvos</a> coming from the
construction arm's <a href="#hir">shoulder</a>.
<p>These recipes may do one of several things: 1) <a href="#fye">pull</a> the elbow
closer to the shoulder, 2) <a href="#gh5">push</a> the elbow farther from the
shoulder, 3) emit a glider on a particular output <a href="#aii">lane</a> (while also
optionally pushing or pulling the elbow); 4) create a "<a href="#ns5">hand</a>" target
block or other useful object as a target for output gliders, to one
side of the <a href="#mfc">construction lane</a>; 5) duplicate the elbow, or 6)
destroy the elbow.
<p>Elbows that receive and emit orthogonally-travelling <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>
instead of gliders are technically possible, but no working examples
are currently known. The discussion below assumes that gliders are
used to communicate between the shoulder, elbow, and hand locations.
<p>If a mechanism can be programmed to generate recipes for at least
the first three options listed above, it is generally capable of
functioning as a <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>. The main requirement is
that push and pull <a href="#f4l">elbow operations</a> should be available that are
either minimal (1<a href="#hpm">fd</a>) or the distances should be relatively prime.
<p>Depending on the <a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> library, there may be only one
type of elbow, or there may be two or more elbow objects, with
recipes that convert between them. The <a href="#rdh">9hd</a> library had just one
elbow type, a block. The original 10<a href="#hv0">hd</a> library had two elbows,
blocks in mirror-symmetric locations; this was expanded to a larger
list for the <a href="#yis">10hd Demonoid</a>. The <a href="#nxn">0hd Demonoid</a> also has a
multi-elbow recipe library. A <a href="#q0o">slow elbow</a> toolkit may make use of
an even larger number of glider output recipes, because the <a href="#qir">target</a>
elbow object in that case is not restricted to a single diagonal
line.
<p>If only one colour, parity, or phase of glider can be emitted, then
the mechanism will be limited to producing <a href="#gk1">monochromatic salvos</a> or
<a href="#qct">monoparity salvos</a>. These are less efficient at most construction
tasks, but are still generally accepted to enable
<a href="#ijt">universal toolkits</a>. See also <a href="#c85">half-baked knightship</a>.
<p>:<a name=gw8><b>construction envelope</b></a> The region affected by an active reaction, such
as a <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a> of an object. The envelope corresponds to
the state-2 blue cells in <a href="#acg">LifeHistory</a>. See also <a href="#tqi">edgy</a>.
<p>:<a name=mfc><b>construction lane</b></a> Part of a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> between the <a href="#hir">shoulder</a>
and the <a href="#g91">elbow</a> - in particular, one of the fixed <a href="#aii">lanes</a> that
<a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> signals travel on. All known
<a href="#eub">universal constructors</a> have used arms with two or more construction
lanes, except for the ones in the <a href="#nxn">0hd Demonoid</a> and in recent
<a href="#way">single-channel</a> construction recipes.
<p>:<a name=eh7><b>construction recipe</b></a> One or more streams of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or other signals
fed into a <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> to create a target object.
Compare <a href="#x1b">glider recipe</a>.
<p>:<b>construction universality</b> See <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<a name=gra><b>converter</b></a> A <a href="#u15">conduit</a> in which the input object is not of the same
type as the output object. This term tends to be preferred when
either the input object or the output object is a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>.
<p>The following diagram shows a p8 <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a>-to-<a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>
converter. This was originally found by Dave Buckingham in a larger
form (using a <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> instead of the <a href="#i0n">boat</a>). The improvement
shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter Leithner has
since found (much larger) <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of periods 44, 46 and 60 that
can be used instead of the <a href="#jif">Kok's galaxy</a>.

<p>For another periodic converter, see the glider-to-LWSS example in

<p>The earliest and simplest stable converters known are shown below.
These are an HWSS-to-loaf, MWSS-to-beehive, and LWSS-to-blinker.
These can serve as <a href="#g5g">memory cells</a>, or as the first steps in
constructing objects using <a href="#i1v">salvos</a>.

<p>:<a name=sgn><b>de Bruijn graph</b></a> As applied to Life, a de Bruijn graph is a graph
showing which pieces can be linked to which other pieces to form a
valid part of a Life pattern of a particular kind.
<p>For example, if we are interested in <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a>, then we could
consider 2&times;3 rectangular pieces and the de Bruijn graph would show
which pairs of these can be overlapped to form 3&times;3 squares in which
the centre cell remains unchanged in the next generation.
<p>David Eppstein's <a href="#reu">search program</a> <a href="#ojz">gfind</a> is based on de Bruijn
graphs.
<p>:<a name=y7t><b>Deep Cell</b></a> A pattern by Jared James Prince, based on David Bell's
<a href="#rx7">unit Life cell</a>, in which each unit cell simulates two Life cells,
in such a way that a Life universe filled with Deep Cells simulates
two independent Life universes running in parallel.
<p>In fact, a Life universe filled with Deep Cells can simulate
infinitely many Life universes, as follows. Let <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>3</sub>, ...
be a sequence of Life patterns. Set the Deep Cells to run a
simulation of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> in parallel with a simulation of a universe filled
with Deep Cells, with these simulated Deep Cells running a simulation
of <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> in parallel with another simulation of a universe filled with
Deep Cells, with these doubly simulated Deep Cells simulating <i>P</i><sub>3</sub> in
parallel with yet another universe of Deep Cells, and so on.
<p>Deep Cell is available from <a href="http://psychoticdeath.com/life.htm">http://psychoticdeath.com/life.htm</a>.
<p>:<a name=knq><b>Demonoid</b></a> The first <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> diagonal spaceship. A 0<a href="#hv0">hd</a>
Demonoid was completed by Chris Cain in December 2015, shortly after
a much larger 10hd version was constructed the previous month in
collaboration with Dave Greene. The 0hd spaceship fits in a bounding
box about 55,000 cells square, and displaces itself by 65 cells
diagonally every 438,852 generations.
<p>The first 0hd Demonoid was fired by a <a href="#xtd">gun</a>. No spaceship gun
pattern had previously been completed before the first appearance of
the actual spaceship.
<p>In June 2017 Dave Greene completed a much simpler <a href="#way">single-channel</a>
Demonoid using a temporary <a href="#og5">lossless elbow</a>, which displaces itself
79 cells diagonally every 1,183,842 ticks. This was an improvement
in terms of design complexity, but not in terms of speed, population,
or bounding box. However, all of these could be further optimized.
A smaller Hashlife-friendly single-channel Demonoid design was
completed in 2018.

places a boat in a location accessible to an input glider. If the

is turned 90 degrees onto a new lane.

If the Herschel and boat are removed from the above pattern, the
glider passes cleanly through the circuit. It can be used as the "0"
output of a one-bit <a href="#g5g">memory cell</a>, where the 90-degree output would
be the "1" output. This was the method used to store presence or
absence of neighbor <a href="#xis">metacells</a> in the <a href="#t7o">p1 megacell</a>.
<p>:<b>demuxer</b> = <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>
<p>:<a name=b8s><b>density</b></a> The density of a pattern is the limit of the proportion of
live cells in a (2<i>n</i>+1)&times;(2<i>n</i>+1) square centred on a particular cell as
<i>n</i> tends to infinity, when this limit exists. (Note that it does not
make any difference what cell is chosen as the centre cell. Also
note that if the pattern is finite then the density is zero.) There
are other definitions of density, but this one will do here.
<p>In 1994 Noam Elkies proved that the maximum density of a stable
pattern is 1/2, which had been the conjectured value. See the paper
listed in the bibliography. Marcus Moore provided a simpler proof in
1995, and in fact proves that a <a href="#gt3">still life</a> with an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i>
<a href="#p6q">bounding box</a> has at most (<i>mn</i>+<i>m</i>+<i>n</i>)/2 cells.
<p>But what is the maximum average density of an oscillating pattern?
The answer is conjectured to be 1/2 again, but this remains unproved.
The best upper bound so far obtained is 8/13 (Hartmut Holzwart,
September 1992).
<p>The maximum possible density for a <a href="#kv9">phase</a> of an oscillating
pattern is also unknown. An example with a density of 3/4 is known
(see <a href="#dsi">agar</a>), but densities arbitrarily close to 1 may perhaps be
possible.
<p>:<a name=dt1><b>dependent conduit</b></a> A <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> in which the input <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
interacts with catalysts in the first few ticks. The standard
interaction actually starts at T=-3, before the Herschel is
completely formed. Compare <a href="#sr2">independent conduit</a>. The Herschel is
prevented from emitting its <a href="#ebs">first natural glider</a>. This is useful
in cases where the previous conduit cannot survive a first natural
glider emitted from its output Herschel.
<p>This term is somewhat confusing, since it is actually the previous
conduit that depends on the dependent conduit to suppress the
problematic glider. Dependent conduits such as the <a href="#ba2">F166</a> and
<a href="#amz">Lx200</a> do not actually depend on anything. They can be freely
connected to any other conduits that fit, as long as the output
Herschel evolves from its standard great-grandparent. As of this
writing, the <a href="#dv1">Fx158</a> is the only known case where a conduit's output
Herschel has an alternate great-grandparent, which is incompatible
with dependent conduits' initial transparent block.
<p>:<a name=dak><b>destructive read</b></a> The most common type of test reaction in
<a href="#g5g">memory cell</a> circuitry. Information is stored in a memory cell by
placing objects in known positions, or by changing the state of a
stable or periodic <a href="#on7">toggle circuit</a>. A destructive-read test
consists of sending one or more <a href="#j4d">signals</a> to the memory cell. A
distinct output signal is produced for each possible state of the
memory cell, which is reset to a known "zero" or "rest" state. See
for example <a href="#u19">boat-bit</a>, <a href="#eqy">keeper</a>, and <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.
<p>To permanently store information in a destructive-read memory cell,
the output signal(s) must be used, in part, to send appropriate
signals back to the memory cell to restore its state to its previous
value. With output looped back to input, this larger composite
circuit then effectively becomes a <a href="#i2f">non-destructive read</a> memory
cell.

glider heading towards an arbitrarily distant blinker.

<a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>, and so allow the creation of <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of periods
not yet attained, and possibly prove that Life is <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>.
Hickerson has found a number of components towards this end, but it
has proved difficult to change the direction of movement of a
drifter, and so far no complete track has been found. However,
Hickerson has had success using the same program to find <a href="#v1v">eaters</a>
with novel properties, such as <a href="#jhr">sparking eaters</a> and the ones shown
in <a href="#d7n">diuresis</a>.
<p>:<b>dual 1-2-3-4</b> = <a href="#bk5">Achim's p4</a>
<p>:<a name=l2f><b>duoplet</b></a> A diagonal two-bit spark produced by many oscillators and
eater reactions. Among other uses, it can reflect gliders 90
degrees. The following pattern shows an <a href="#uig">eater5</a> eating gliders and
producing duoplets which are then used to reflect a separate glider
stream. If only one glider is present, the eater5 successfully
absorbs it, so this mechanism may be considered to be a simple AND
gate.

<p>Some common <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> can act as eaters in some situations,
such as the <a href="#dp5">block</a>, <a href="#ch9">ship</a>, and <a href="#r3y">tub</a>. In fact the block was the
first known eater, being found capable of eating beehives from a
<a href="#sxo">queen bee</a>.

<p>This eater can be constructed using a simple two-glider collision,
as shown in <a href="#g4c">stamp collection</a>. It is often modified in various
ways, or <a href="#s6n">welded</a> to other objects, to allow tighter packing of
<a href="#tka">circuits</a> or to allow a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#goz">stream</a> to pass close by. See
<a href="#ng0">clearance</a> for an eater1 variant that is 1<a href="#hv0">hd</a> shorter to the
southeast than the standard fishhook form. An eater1 can also be
used as a 90-degree <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a>.
<p>Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by Bill Gosper in
1971. The fishhook eater can consume a glider, a <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, and a
<a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> as shown below. It is not able to consume an <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>, however.

<p>:<a name=uid><b>eater2</b></a> (p1) This <a href="#v1v">eater</a> was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary <a href="#uic">eater1</a> but with two slight
differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes longer to
recover from each bite, and it can eat objects appearing at two
different positions.

The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a
<a href="#p9q">glider</a> in a position that would destroy an <a href="#uic">eater1</a>. This novel
glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined
with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders travelling
along four adjacent glider <a href="#aii">lanes</a>, as shown below.
<p>The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be
useful for obtaining smaller <a href="#p6q">bounding boxes</a>. A more compact
variant with the same purpose can be seen under <a href="#k51">gliderless</a>.

<p>:<a name=abo><b>elementary</b></a> Not reducible to a combination of smaller parts.
Elementary <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> in particular are usually those found by
search programs, and they can't be subdivided into smaller
spaceships, tagalongs, and supporting reactions, as contrasted with
engineered <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>.
<p>:<a name=rb6><b>elementary conduit</b></a> A <a href="#u15">conduit</a> with no recognizable active signal
stage besides its input and output. An early example still very
commonly used is Buckingham's <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a>, which transforms a
<a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a> into an inverted <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> in 59 ticks. The BFx59H
elementary conduit is a component in many of the original <a href="#mk4">universal</a>
<a href="#uxc">toolkit</a> of Herschel conduits. An extension of the same naming
convention is used for elementary conduits, with the first and last
letters of the name specifying the input and output <a href="#j4d">signal</a> objects.
As with Herschels, an arbitrary orientation and center point is
chosen for each object. "Fx" means the signal moves forward and
produces a mirror-image output. See <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> for further
details.
<p>Theoretically an elementary conduit may become a composite conduit,
if another conduit can be found that shares the beginning or end of
the conduit in question. In practice this happens only rarely,
because many of the most likely branch points have already been
identified: <a href="#p9q">glider</a> (G), <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> (L) or <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> (M), <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> (H),
<a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a> (B), <a href="#rax">R-pentomino</a> (R), <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a> (P),
<a href="#th5">queen bee shuttle</a> (Q), <a href="#amn">century</a> or <a href="#fmz">bookend</a> (C), <a href="#cxz">dove</a> (D), and
<a href="#w3v">wing</a> (W). A <a href="#q14">Herschel descendant</a> might qualify, due to the
elementary conduit that can be seen in the <a href="#ell">p184 gun</a>. However,
there are very few simple conduits that produce Herschel descendants
without Herschels, so in practice this is not a useful branch point.

<p>:<a name=ipa><b>emu</b></a> Dave Buckingham's term for a <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a> that does not emit
<a href="#p9q">gliders</a> (and so is "flightless"). All known Herschel loops of
periods 52, 57, 58, 59 and 61 are emus. See also <a href="#wls">Quetzal</a>.
<p>:<a name=ee5><b>emulator</b></a> Any one of three p4 oscillators that produce <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>
similar to those produced by <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> and <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>. See
<a href="#lp4">LW emulator</a>, <a href="#ce0">MW emulator</a> and <a href="#xnv">HW emulator</a>. Larger emulators are
also possible, but they require stabilizing objects to suppress their
<a href="#vdp">non-sparks</a> and so are of little use. The emulators were discovered
by Robert Wainwright in June 1980.
<p>:<a name=d4y><b>engine</b></a> The active portion of an object (usually a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> or <a href="#xtd">gun</a>)
which is considered to actually produce its output, and which
generally permits no variation in how it works. The other parts of
the object are just there to support the engine. For examples, see
<a href="#eth">puffer train</a>, <a href="#npa">Schick engine</a>, <a href="#qm9">blinker puffer</a>, <a href="#y5g">frothing puffer</a>
and <a href="#et1">line puffer</a>.
<p>:<b>engineless</b> A <a href="#fnm">rake</a> or <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which does not contain a specific
<a href="#d4y">engine</a> for its operation. Instead it depends on perturbations of
gliders or other objects by passing spaceships. The period of such
objects is often adjustable, and in some cases the speed as well. An
early example was the creation of <i>c</i>/5 rakes in September 1997, using
gliders circulating among a convoy of <i>c</i>/5 spaceships. More recently,
the passing spaceships themselves are also constructed, as in the
<a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>.

<p>The conduit's <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> is 227 ticks, slower than many of the
original sixteen conduits because of the delayed destruction of a
temporary blinker, though the circuit itself is clearly <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>.
The recovery time can be improved to 120 ticks by adding <a href="#uyk">sparkers</a>
of various periods to suppress the blinker. See <a href="#kfr">clock</a> for a

This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found in
July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright in 1990, and
the block factory is <a href="#v31">Achim's p144</a> minus one of its stabilizing
blocks. For a block factory using stable components and triggered by
an input <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>, see also <a href="#eqy">keeper</a>.
<p>:<a name=eki><b>familiar fours</b></a> Common patterns of four identical objects. The five
commonest are <a href="#ndw">traffic light</a> (4 blinkers), <a href="#v51">honey farm</a> (4
beehives), <a href="#yw9">blockade</a> (4 blocks), <a href="#ir0">fleet</a> (4 ships, although really 2
ship-ties) and <a href="#js1">bakery</a> (4 loaves, although really 2 bi-loaves).
Also sometimes included is <a href="#yre">four skewed blocks</a>.
<p>:<a name=iwu><b>fanout</b></a> A mechanism that emits two or more objects of some type for
each one that it receives. Typically the objects are <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or
<a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>; <a href="#pzu">glider duplicators</a> are a special case.
<p>:<a name=c0a><b>Fast Forward Force Field</b></a> The following reaction found by Dieter
Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the
gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow
the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6
generations.

<p>The illusion of super-light-speed travel is caused by an LWSS that
is always created, but is then destroyed in some cases, by a signal
catching up to it from behind that necessarily never travels faster
than the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>. It is not possible to make any use of the
apparent super-light-speed signal. The front end of an output LWSS
can't be distinguished from the alternative dying <a href="#eh8">spark</a> output
until several more ticks have passed. Not surprisingly, this extra
time is enough to drop the average speed of information transmission
safely below <i>c</i>.
<p>Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his
favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.

<p>:<a name=uv6><b>fate</b></a> The result of evolving a pattern until its final behaviour is
known. This answers such questions such as whether or not the
pattern remains finite, what its growth rate is, what <a href="#ve5">period</a> the
final state may settle into, and what its final <a href="#y9n">census</a> is. All
small Life objects seem to eventually settle down into a mix of
oscillators, simple spaceships, and occasionally small puffers. See
<a href="#mst">methuselah</a>, <a href="#dnq">soup</a>, <a href="#fdc">ash</a>.
<p>Most sufficiently large random patterns are expected to grow
forever due to the production of <a href="#i53">switch engines</a> at their boundary.
Engineered Life objects - and therefore also sufficiently large and
unlikely random patterns - can have more interesting behaviour, such
as <a href="#q4w">breeders</a>, <a href="#lge">sawtooths</a>, and prime calculators. Some objects have
even been constructed or designed having an <a href="#uxb">unknown fate</a>.

it really does exhibit infinite growth is therefore equivalent to a

however, still be growing at generation 10<sup>2585827975</sup>. The pattern is

<p>:<b>finger</b> A protruding cell in an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or <a href="#pi3">dying spark</a>, with
the ability to modify a nearby active reaction. Like a <a href="#fot">thumb</a>, a
finger cell appears at the edge of a reaction envelope and is the
only live cell in its row or column. The finger spark remains alive
for two ticks before dying, whereas a thumb cell dies after one tick.
Because the key cell is kept alive for an extra tick, an alternate
technical term is "held (orthogonal) bit spark". A "held diagonal
bit spark" is not possible in B3/S23 for obvious reasons.
<p>:<a name=czl><b>fire</b></a> An encoded signal used in combination with <a href="#gh5">push</a> and <a href="#fye">pull</a>
<a href="#f4l">elbow operations</a> in a simple <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a>. When a FIRE
signal is sent, the construction-arm elbow produces an output glider,
usually at 90 degrees from the construction arm. This terminology is
generally used when there is only a single recipe for such a glider
output, or only one recipe for each glider colour (e.g., FIRE WHITE,
FIRE BLACK).
<p>:<a name=a7q><b>fireship</b></a> (<i>c</i>/10 orthogonally, p10) A variant of the <a href="#sje">copperhead</a> with
a trailing component that emits several large <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>, discovered by
Simon Ekstr&ouml;m on 20 March 2016. The interaction between the
copperhead and the additional component is minimal enough that the
extension technically fits the definition of a <a href="#ib1">tagalong</a>. However,
the extension slightly modifies two of the <a href="#kv9">phases</a> of the spaceship,
starting two ticks after the phase shown below, so it's also valid to
classify the fireship as a distinct spaceship.

<p>:<a name=e3i><b>fly-by deletion</b></a> A reaction performed by a passing <a href="#lx2">convoy</a> of
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> which deletes a common stationary object without harming
the convoy. Fly-by deletion is often used in the construction of
<a href="#u5t">puffers</a> and <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> to clean up unwanted debris.
<p>For <i>c</i>/2 convoys this is not usually difficult since the <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>,
<a href="#dfv">MWSS</a>, and <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a> <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> have such useful <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>. However,
some objects are more difficult to delete. For example, deleting a
<a href="#r3y">tub</a> appears to require an unusual p4 spaceship.

<p>The deletion of a <a href="#n2s">pond</a> appears to require a convoy which is 89
cells in width containing a very unusual p4 spaceship which has 273
cells. There are small objects which have no known fly-by deletion
reactions. However, as in the case of <a href="#y2a">reanimation</a>, hitting them
with the output of <a href="#fnm">rakes</a> is an effective brute force method.

<p>:<a name=r77><b>freeze-dried</b></a> A term used for a <a href="#ciy">glider constructible</a> <a href="#fnr">seed</a> that can
activated in some way to produce a complex object. For example, a
"freeze-dried salvo" is a constellation of constructible objects
which, when <a href="#idj">triggered</a> by a single glider, produces a unidirectional
glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>, and nothing else. Freeze-dried salvos can be useful
in <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> constructions, especially when an active circuit has
to destroy or reconstruct itself in a limited amount of time.
Gradual modification by a <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> may be too slow, or the
circuit doing the construction may itself be the object that must be
modified.
<p>The concept may be applied to other types of objects. For example,
one possible way to build a gun for a <a href="#jbk">waterbear</a> would be to program
a construction arm to build a freeze-dried waterbear seed, and then
trigger it when the construction is complete.

<p>This edge shooter has an unusually high 27<a href="#hv0">hd</a> clearance, one of
the highest known for a single small component. The only known
higher-clearance edge shooters are injectors making use of multiple
interacting spaceships. This makes the Fx119 inserter ideal for the
construction of wide <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> whose total width can fit within its
clearance distance.
<p>The component creates a large cloud of <a href="#ogq">smoke</a> behind its emitted
glider which lasts for over 90 generations. In spite of this, many
tightly packed convoys can be made by injecting later gliders behind
others in the convoy, helped along by the insertion reaction which is
able to catch up to the existing gliders. The Fx119 inserter can
place a glider on the same lane as a passing glider and as close as
15 ticks behind, which is only one step away from the minimum
possible following distance.

<p>:<a name=vke><b>Gemini</b></a> ((5120,1024)<i>c</i>/33699586 obliquely, p33699586) The first
<a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> spaceship, and also the first <a href="#f5n">oblique</a>
spaceship. It was made public by Andrew Wade on 18 May 2010. It was
the thirteenth explicitly constructed spaceship velocity in Life, and
made possible an infinite family of related velocities. The Gemini
spaceship derives its name from the Latin "gemini", meaning twins,
describing its two identical halves, each of which contains three
Chapman-Greene <a href="#bwp">construction arms</a>. A tape of gliders continually
relays between the two halves, instructing each to delete its parent
and construct a daughter configuration.
<p>:<b>Gemini puffer</b> See <a href="#ylp">Pianola breeder</a>.
<p>:<a name=gf5><b>Geminoid</b></a> A type of self-constructing circuitry that borrows key ideas
from Andrew Wade's <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship, but with several
simplifications. The main feature common to the Gemini spaceship is
the construction recipe encoding method. Information is stored
directly, and much more efficiently, in the timings of moving
gliders, rather than in a static tape with 1s and 0s encoded by the
presence of small stationary objects.
<p>Unlike the original Gemini, Geminoids have <a href="#rb5">ambidextrous</a>
construction arms, initially using glider pairs on two lanes
separated by 9<a href="#hv0">hd</a>, 10hd, or 0hd. The design was the basis for the
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a> and the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a>. A more recent development
is a Geminoid toolkit using a <a href="#way">single-channel</a> construction arm,
which allows for the possibility of multiple elbows with no loss of
efficiency, or the construction of temporary lossless elbows.
Compare <a href="#q0o">slow elbow</a>.
<p>Other new developments that could be considered part of the
extended "Geminoid" toolkit include <a href="#r77">freeze-dried</a> construction
salvos and seeds, used when objects must be built within a short time
window, and self-destruct circuits, which are used as an alternative
to a <a href="#stf">destructor arm</a> to clean up temporary objects in a similarly
short window.

from one or more incoming <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> assisted by the presence of
the GIG. (This contrasts with some other glider injection reactions
which do not require a GIG, as in <a href="#aob">inject</a>.) Gliders already in the
glider stream pass through the GIG without interfering with it. A
GIG usually consists of a small number of oscillators.
<p>For example, in July 1996 Dieter Leithner found the following
reaction which allows the construction of a pseudo-period 14 glider

<p>Spaceship <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> that can duplicate gliders are very useful
since they (along with <a href="#ix1">glider turners</a>) provide a means to clean up
many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to
impact into the <a href="#csj">exhaust</a> to clean it up.
<p>Glider duplicators and turners are known for backward gliders using
p2 <i>c</i>/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 <i>c</i>/3 spaceships.
These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.

<p>:<a name=p4s><b>glider synthesis</b></a> Construction of an object by means of <a href="#p9q">glider</a>
collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be
arranged so that they could come from infinity. That is, gliders
should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the
initial arrangement.
<p>Glider syntheses for all <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> and known <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> with
at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham. As of June 2018,
this limit has been increased to 18 cells.
<p>Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, because these can be used to create corresponding
<a href="#xtd">guns</a> and <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>. Many of the <i>c</i>/2 spaceships that are based on
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a> have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec.
In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the
<a href="#we6">Corderships</a> (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers
used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies
suggested that a 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be
a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a
synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in
March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform
the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build
a <i>c</i>/2 forward rake for the 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship; this was the first example
in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same
direction as the rake but more slowly.
<p>A 3-glider synthesis of a <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a> is shown in the diagram
below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a
surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three
gliders would already be known.

<p>:<a name=y9d><b>Gotts dots</b></a> A 41-cell 187&times;39 <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a> pattern found by
Bill Gosper in March 2006, who named it in honour of Nick Gotts,
discoverer of many other low-population superlinear patterns, such as
<a href="#mwj">Jaws</a>, the <a href="#maw">mosquitoes</a>, <a href="#b33">teeth</a>, <a href="#h14">catacryst</a> and <a href="#xrn">metacatacryst</a>.
See <a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a> for the lowest-population
<a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a> pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of
the record-holders.
<p>Collisions within the pattern cause it to sprout its Nth
<a href="#i53">switch engine</a> at generation T = ~224<i>n</i>-6. The population of the
pattern at time <i>t</i> is asymptotically proportional to <i>t</i> times log(<i>t</i>),
so the growth rate is O(<i>t</i> ln(<i>t</i>)), faster than <a href="#jru">linear growth</a> but
slower than <a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a>.

<p>:<b>grandfather</b> = <a href="#iaf">grandparent</a>
<p>:<b>grandfatherless</b> A traditional name for a pattern with one or more

<p>:<a name=iaf><b>grandparent</b></a> A pattern is said to be a grandparent of the pattern it
gives rise to after two generations. For over thirty years, a
well-known open problem was the question of whether any pattern
existed that had a parent but no grandparent. In 1972, <a href="#opm">LifeLine</a>
Volume 6 mentioned John Conway's offer of a $50 prize for a solution
to the problem, but it remained open until May 2016 when a user with
the conwaylife.com forum handle 'mtve' posted an example.
<p>Other patterns have since been found that have a grandparent but no
great-grandparent, or a great-grandparent but no
great-great-grandparent. Further examples in this series almost
certainly exist, but as of July 2018 none have yet been found.

<p>:<a name=tk9><b>growing spaceship</b></a> An object that moves like a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, except
that its front part moves faster than its back part and a <a href="#vac">wick</a>
extends between the two. Put another way, a growing spaceship is a
<a href="#u5t">puffer</a> whose output is burning <a href="#nhx">cleanly</a> at a slower rate than the
puffer is producing it. Examples include <a href="#sav">blinker ships</a>,
<a href="#ko9">pi ships</a>, and some <a href="#wsu">wavestretchers</a>.
<p>:<b>G-to-H</b> A <a href="#gra">converter</a> that takes a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> as an input <a href="#j4d">signal</a> and
produces a <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> output, which can then be used by other
<a href="#u15">conduits</a>. G-to-Hs are frequently used in <a href="#qup">stable</a> logic circuitry.
Early examples include <a href="#ogp">Callahan G-to-H</a>, <a href="#qyx">Silver G-to-H</a>, and
<a href="#iam">p8 G-to-H</a> for periodic circuits. A more compact recent example is

<a href="#d29">new gun</a> and <a href="#w43">true</a>.
<p>:<a name=bqa><b>gunstar</b></a> Any of a series of glider <a href="#xtd">guns</a> of period 144+72<i>n</i> (for all
non-negative integers <i>n</i>) constructed by Dave Buckingham in 1990 based
on his <a href="#ffu">transparent block reaction</a> and Robert Wainwright's p72
oscillator (shown under <a href="#wle">factory</a>).
<p>:<a name=dz9><b>gutter</b></a> A single straight line of cells along the axis of symmetry of
a mirror-<a href="#coi">symmetric</a> pattern. Most commonly this is an orthogonal
line, and the pattern is then odd-symmetric (as opposed to
even-symmetric, where the axis of symmetry follows the boundary
between two rows or columns of cells).
<p>The birth rule for Conway's Life trivially implies that if there
are no live cells in the gutter of a symmetric pattern, new cells can
never be born there. For examples, see <a href="#chz">44P5H2V0</a>, <a href="#s22">60P5H2V0</a>,

<p><a name=H>:</a><a name=c85><b>half-baked knightship</b></a> ((6,3)<i>c</i>/2621440, p2621440) A <a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a>
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a> with adjustable period but fixed direction, based
on the <a href="#nkc">half-bakery reaction</a>. This was the first spaceship based on
this reaction, constructed in December 2014 by Adam P. Goucher. It
moves 6 cells horizontally and 3 cells vertically every 2621440+8<i>N</i>
ticks, depending on the relative spacing of the two halves. It is
one of the slowest known <a href="#nl7">knightships</a>, and the first one that was
not a <a href="#gf5">Geminoid</a>. Chris Cain optimized the design a few days later to
create the <a href="#bf1">Parallel HBK</a>.
<p>The spaceship produces gliders from near-diagonal lines of
half-bakeries, which collide with each other at 180 degrees. These
collisions produce <a href="#gk1">monochromatic salvos</a> that gradually build and
trigger <a href="#fnr">seeds</a>, which in turn eventually construct small
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> <a href="#i1v">salvos</a> of gliders. These re-activate the lines of
half-bakeries, thus closing the cycle and moving the entire spaceship
obliquely by (6,3).
<p>:<b>half bakery</b> = <a href="#cq9">bi-loaf</a>.
<p>:<a name=nkc><b>half-bakery reaction</b></a> The key reaction used in the
<a href="#c85">half-baked knightship</a> and <a href="#bf1">Parallel HBK</a>, where a half-bakery is
moved by (6,3) when a glider collides with it, and the glider
continues on a new lane. Ivan Fomichev noticed in May 2014 that
pairs of these reactions at the correct relative spacing can create
90-degree output gliders:

<p>:<a name=dtq><b>hashlife</b></a> A Life algorithm by Bill Gosper that is designed to take
advantage of the considerable amount of repetitive behaviour in many
large patterns of interest. It provides a means of evolving
repetitive patterns millions (or even billions or trillions) of
generations further than normal Life algorithms can manage in a
reasonable amount of time.
<p>The hashlife algorithm is described by Gosper in his paper listed
in the bibliography at the end of this lexicon. Roughly speaking,
the idea is to store subpatterns in a hash table so that the results
of their <a href="#t2z">evolution</a> do not need to be recomputed if they arise again
at some other place or time in the evolution of the full pattern.
This does, however, mean that complex patterns can require
substantial amounts of memory.
<p>Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow implemented Hashlife into
<a href="#s47">Golly</a> in 2005. See also <a href="#xd9">macrocell</a>.

<p>:<a name=etl><b>heptomino</b></a> Any 7-cell <a href="#ml6">polyomino</a>. There are 108 such objects. Those
with names in common use are the <a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a>, the <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> and
the <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a>.
<p>:<a name=e7u><b>Herschel</b></a> (stabilizes at time 128) The following pattern which occurs
at generation 20 of the <a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a>.
<pre>

</pre>
<p>The name is commonly ascribed to the Herschel heptomino's
similarity to a planetary symbol. William Herschel discovered Uranus
in 1781. However, in point of fact a Herschel bears no particular
resemblance to either of the symbols used for Uranus, but does
closely resemble the symbol for Saturn. So the appropriate name might
actually be "Huygens", but "Herschel" is now universally used by
tradition.
<p>Herschels are one of the most versatile types of <a href="#j4d">signal</a> in stable
circuitry. <a href="#rax">R-pentominoes</a> and <a href="#saf">B-heptominoes</a> naturally evolve into
Herschels, and <a href="#gra">converters</a> have also been found that change
<a href="#se4">pi-heptominoes</a> and several other signal types into Herschels, and
vice versa. See <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a>.
<p>:<a name=iod><b>Herschel circuit</b></a> A series of <a href="#j58">Herschel conduits</a> or other components,
connected by placing them so that the output <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a> from early
conduits become the input Herschels for later conduits. Often the
initial component is a <a href="#gra">converter</a> accepting some other signal type
as input - usually a glider, in which case a <a href="#fzn">syringe</a> is most
commonly used. The <a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a> is a well-known early
<a href="#ret">Spartan</a> Herschel circuit from before the syringe was discovered,
where the initial converter is a <a href="#ogp">Callahan G-to-H</a>.
<p>Sometimes a direct connection between two conduits is not possible
due to unwanted gliders that destroy required <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>, or wanted
gliders that are not able to escape. In this case, small "spacer"
conduits such as <a href="#awl">F116</a>, <a href="#awm">F117</a>, <a href="#lfj">Fx77</a>, <a href="#s7l">R64</a>, <a href="#g9o">L112</a>, or <a href="#gkk">L156</a> can
be inserted between the other conduits to solve the problem.
<p>Some converter or <a href="#wle">factory</a> conduits do not produce a Herschel as
output, instead generating other useful results such as gliders,
<a href="#i0n">boats</a> or <a href="#dfv">MWSSes</a>. See <a href="#rai">Herschel-to-glider</a>, <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>, and
<a href="#rhe">H-to-MWSS</a> respectively for examples of these. For those conduits
which do produce an unwanted Herschel, an <a href="#v1v">eater</a> such as <a href="#fxr">SW-2</a> can
be added to delete it.
<p>If the first and last conduits of a chain connect to each other in
a loop then there is no need for a syringe to generate the first
Herschel, or an eater to consume the last one. The circuit becomes a
self-supporting <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a>. A loop is also formed by a
<a href="#fzn">syringe</a> connected to a Herschel-to-glider converter, with the
glider reflected back to the syringe's input with glider reflectors
of the appropriate colour, usually <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a>. In either case, if the
loop has a surplus <a href="#p9q">glider</a> output, it becomes a <a href="#xtd">gun</a>; if no output
is available it is an <a href="#ipa">emu</a>.

<p>Well over a hundred simple stable Herschel conduits are currently
known. As of June 2018 the number is approximately 150, depending on
the precise definition of "simple" - e.g., fitting inside a 100&times;100
bounding box, and producing output in no more than 300 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>. In
general a Herschel conduit can be called "simple" if its active
reaction does not return to a Herschel stage except at its output.
Compare <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a>, <a href="#fx0">composite conduit</a>. A description of
common usage in complex circuitry, using <a href="#fzn">syringes</a> and <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a> to
make compact connections, can be found in <a href="#iod">Herschel circuit</a>.
<p>The original <a href="#mk4">universal</a> set consisted of sixteen stable Herschel
conduits, discovered between 1995 and 1998 by Dave Buckingham (DJB)
and Paul Callahan (PBC). These are shown in the following table. In
this table, the number in "name/steps" is the number of <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>
needed to produce an output Herschel from the input Herschel. "m"
tells how the Herschel is moved (R = turned right, L = turned left, B
= turned back, F = unturned, f = flipped), and "dx" and "dy" give the
displacement of the centre cell of the Herschel (assumed to start in
the orientation shown above).

<p>Dependent conduit inputs are catalysed by a <a href="#o6q">transparent</a> block
before the Herschel's standard form can appear, and before the
Herschel's <a href="#ebs">first natural glider</a> is produced. This means that these
conduits will fail if an actual Herschel is placed in the "correct"
input location for a dependent conduit. Refer to <a href="#ba2">F166</a> or <a href="#amz">Lx200</a>
to see the correct relative placement of the standard transparent
block catalyst.
<p>Almost all known Herschel conduits produce a Herschel
great-grandparent near the end of their evolutionary sequence. In
the original <a href="#mk4">universal</a> set of Herschel conduits, <a href="#dv1">Fx158</a> is the
only exception.
<p>:<a name=rmc><b>Herschel loop</b></a> A cyclic <a href="#oa6">Herschel track</a>. Although no loop of length
less than 120 generations has been constructed it is possible to make
<a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of smaller periods by putting more than one Herschel in
a higher-period track. In this way oscillators, and in most cases
<a href="#xtd">guns</a>, of all periods from 54 onwards can now be constructed
(although the p55 case is a bit strange, shooting itself with gliders
in order to stabilize itself). A mechanism for a period-52 loop was
found in April 2018, but it includes a stage where the signal is
carried by a triplet of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> so it may not be considered to be a
pure Herschel loop. The missing period, 53, is a difficult case
simply because 53 is prime and so no small sparkers or reflectors are
available.
<p>See <a href="#iwj">Simkin glider gun</a> and <a href="#l61">p256 gun</a> for the smallest known

<a href="#vj8">reflector</a>. Used as a receiver, it converts two parallel input
gliders (with path separations of 2, 5, or 6) to an <a href="#rax">R-pentomino</a>.
The signal is then converted to a Herschel by one of several known
mechanisms, the first of which was found by Dave Buckingham way back
in 1972. The second is <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a> <a href="#twv">RF48H</a>, found by
Stephen Silver in October 1997. The receiver version shown below

<p>This term is also sometimes used to refer to any mechanism that
cleanly suppresses a Herschel. These usually allow the Herschel's

<p>:<a name=a38><b>honey bit</b></a> A block and pond <a href="#th3">constellation</a> used in the
<a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a> by Brice Due in 2006, to store and retrieve a bit of
data - specifically, the presence or absence of a neighbor
<a href="#xis">metacell</a>. The "0" state of the honey bit memory unit is a simple
<a href="#ktx">beehive</a>, which is also the source of the name.
<p>An input glider collides with the beehive to convert it into the
honey bit constellation, which can be thought of as a value of "1"
stored in the memory unit. A passing LWSS can then test for the
presence of the pond. If a collision occurs, the LWSS and the honey
bit constellation are mutually annihilated, leaving just the original
beehive. Below is the honeybit constellation with the two reactions
occurring in the opposite order - test, then reset.

If the pond is not present, the LWSS passes by the beehive without
affecting it. Thus a test input has an output for the "0" case, but
not for the "1" case. For an alternative memory-unit mechanism with
both "0" and "1" outputs, see <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.
<p>The honey bit is also an interesting <a href="#v1v">eater</a> for the <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a> as
shown below. An HWSS colliding with the pond happens to create the
exact same reset glider used in the above memory unit.

<p>:<a name=dlj><b>infinite glider hotel</b></a> A pattern by David Bell, named after Hilbert's
"infinite hotel" scenario in which a hotel with an infinite number of
rooms has room for more guests even if it is already full, simply by
shuffling the old guests around.
<p>In this pattern, two pairs of <a href="#we6">Corderships</a> moving at <i>c</i>/12 are
pulling apart such that there is an ever-lengthening <a href="#p9q">glider</a> track
between them. Every 128 generations another glider is <a href="#aob">injected</a>
into the glider track (see <a href="#tv3">LWSS-glider bounce</a>), joining the gliders
already circulating there. The number of gliders in the track
therefore increases without limit.
<p>The tricky part of this construction is that even though all the
previously injected gliders are repeatedly flying through the
injection point, that point is guaranteed to be empty when it is time
for the next glider to be injected.
<p>:<a name=rku><b>infinite growth</b></a> Growth of a finite pattern such that the <a href="#n9e">population</a>
tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is
used for growth of something other than population (for example,
length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth.
The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the
<a href="#mp9">Gosper glider gun</a>, created in a response to a $50 prize challenge
by John Conway. Martin Gardner's October 1970 article described the
challenge as "Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without
limit", but Conway later explained that he had always expected that
this would be disproved. The original purpose in investigating CA
rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule
could support a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a> and/or <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of
these would be possible.
<p>An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a
pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman
found that a <a href="#i53">switch engine</a> could be stabilized by a <a href="#vvb">pre-block</a> in
a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite
growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until
Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with
infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below,
which is much neater, being a single <a href="#tsb">cluster</a>. This produces a
stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.
<pre>
	......O.
	....O.OO
	....O.O.
	....O...
	..O.....
	O.O.....
</pre>
Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan showed in October 1997 that there is no
infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that question
has now been answered.
<p>In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision
that produces a glider-producing <a href="#tlb">stabilized switch engine</a> and thus
produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders
(since all 71 <a href="#uha">2-glider collisions</a> have a finite limit population).
<p>Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by
Callahan), which is the only 5&times;5 pattern with infinite growth. This
too emits a block-laying switch engine.
<pre>

<p>Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in
May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This
pattern was very large (12470&times;1 in the first version, reduced to
5447&times;1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an
exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39&times;1 pattern
shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines,
stability being achieved at generation 1483.

Larger patterns have since been constructed that display
<a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a>.
<p>Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that
is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are
possible, <a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a> (see also <a href="#q4w">breeder</a>) being the fastest.
Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates,
such as <a href="#lge">sawtooths</a> and a <a href="#tyd">caber tosser</a>. Another pattern with
superlinear but non-quadratic growth is <a href="#y9d">Gotts dots</a>.

<p>:<b>initials</b> = <a href="#ylm">monogram</a>
<p>:<a name=aob><b>inject</b></a> A reaction in which a hole in a regular spaceship stream is

on the period of the stream, different mechanisms can be used. For
adding a spaceship to an existing multi-lane <a href="#lx2">convoy</a>, see
<a href="#nxt">inserter</a>.
<p>For large period glider streams, simple reactions such as
<a href="#orn">LWSS-LWSS bounce</a> and <a href="#tv3">LWSS-glider bounce</a> suffice. If <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
technology is used, a large number of <a href="#he2">edge shooters</a> and

insertion method, in the sense that fewer <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> <a href="#j4d">signals</a>

<p>:<a name=pag><b>intermittent stream</b></a> A <a href="#goz">stream</a> of spaceships which is based on a
periodic stream, but which can contain holes where some of the
spaceships are not present. There is a base period for the
intermittent stream such that if a spaceship arrives at a specific
location, then it always does so at a generation which is a multiple
of the base period. For example, the output from a period 30 glider
gun where every third glider is deleted is an intermittent stream. A
<a href="#lxa">pseudo-random glider generator</a> can produce a complicated
intermittent stream with no obvious pattern.
<p>Intermittent streams can be used to transmit <a href="#j4d">signals</a>, where holes
in the stream can also convey information. For example, the stream
can be processed by an <a href="#e1h">inverter</a> having the same period.
<p>:<a name=vq5><b>intermitting glider gun</b></a> Despite the name, an intermitting glider gun
(IMG) is more often an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> than a <a href="#xtd">gun</a>. There are two
basic types. A type 1 IMG consists of two guns firing at one another
in such a way that each gun is temporarily disabled on being hit by a
glider from the other gun. A type 2 IMG consists of a single gun
firing at a 180-degree glider <a href="#vj8">reflector</a> in such a way that
returning gliders temporarily disable the gun.
<p>Both types of IMG can be used to make glider guns of periods that
are multiples of the base period. This is done by firing another gun
across the two-way <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> of gliders in the IMG in
such a way that gliders only occasionally escape.
<p>:<a name=e1h><b>inverter</b></a> A device which can be used to invert the presence or absence
of spaceships in an <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> of spaceships. The device
must be a gun whose period matches the base period of the stream,
since if there are no input spaceships then the device must produce
spaceships as the result of the inversion. Typically the spaceships
are gliders, and the inverter is made from a glider gun. Inverters
provide a way to produce a NOT logic operation on a stream.
<p>There are several ways to produce an inverter. The simplest method
is to simply hit the output of a gun with the input stream to delete
its spaceships, producing an output stream that is always turned 90
degrees from the input stream. An example is the northernmost p30
gun in the <a href="#pzu">glider duplicator</a> example pattern. For one way to
produce an inverted output stream which is not turned, see

<p>:<a name=mwj><b>Jaws</b></a> A <a href="#q4w">breeder</a> constructed by Nick Gotts in February 1997. In the

the time was the smallest for any known pattern with
<a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>. In November 1997 Gotts produced a 130-cell

<p>Jaws consists of eight pairs of switch engines which produce a new
block-laying switch engine (plus masses of junk) every 10752
generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder.

<p>:<a name=abn><b>Klein bottle</b></a> As an alternative to a <a href="#lu8">torus</a>, it's possible to make a
finite Life universe in the form of a Klein bottle. The simplest way
to do this is to use an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i> rectangle with the top edge joined to
the bottom edge (as for a torus) and the left edge twisted and joined
to the right.
<p>:<a name=nl7><b>knightship</b></a> Any <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> of type (2<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> - that is, a spaceship of
any speed that moves obliquely in a (2,1) direction. The first
Conway's Life knightship was a variant of Andrew Wade's <a href="#vke">Gemini</a>
spaceship, constructed in May 2010. The next was an even slower
knightship based on the <a href="#nkc">half-bakery reaction</a>.
<p>A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at least 6.
This is barely within the range of current <a href="#reu">search programs</a>, as
proven by the discovery on March 6, 2018 of an <a href="#abo">elementary</a>
knightship, <a href="#c8a">Sir Robin</a>, by Adam P. Goucher and Tomas Rokicki.
<p>By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of
types (3<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i>, (3<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> and (4<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> would presumably be called
camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. Such
spaceships do exist (see <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>) but small
elementary versions are even more difficult to search for. Any of
these ship types could be constructed by trivially modifying a Gemini
spaceship, or less trivially by reprogramming one of the more recent
small <a href="#gf5">Geminoid</a> <a href="#bwp">construction arms</a>, but as of July 2018 a camelship
Gemini is the only example that has been explicitly built.
<p>Alternatively, the term "knightship" is regularly used to refer to
any <a href="#f5n">oblique</a> spaceship, such as the original <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> or the
<a href="#jbk">waterbear</a>.

<p>Diagonal lanes are often numbered consecutively, in half-diagonals
(<a href="#hv0">hd</a>). Occasionally diagonal lane measurements are given in
quarter-diagonals (<a href="#ij9">qd</a>), in part because diagonally symmetric
spaceships have a line of symmetry 1qd away from the lines available
for gliders. It's also convenient that moving a glider forward by

for 100 ticks.

Jason Summers discovered a lightspeed reaction travelling through an

<p>A <a href="#qup">stable</a> lightspeed <a href="#j7m">transceiver</a> mechanism using this same
signal reaction, the <a href="#shf">p1 telegraph</a>, was constructed by Adam P.
Goucher in 2010; the bounding boxes of both the <a href="#cpd">transmitter</a> and
<a href="#r79">receiver</a> are over 5000 cells on a side. A more compact periodic
<a href="#wak">high-bandwidth telegraph</a> with a much improved transmission rate was
completed by Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois Handfield in 2017.
<p>The following diagram shows an older example of a lightspeed wire,
with a small defect that travels along it at the speed of light. As
of June 2018, no method has been found of creating such a defect in
the upstream end of this particular stable wire, or of
non-destructively detecting the arrival of the defect and repairing
the wire at the downstream end.

<p>:<a name=d9l><b>linear propagator</b></a> A self-replicating pattern in which each copy of a

child pattern then blocks the parent from any further replication.
An example was constructed by Dave Greene on 23 November 2013, with a
construction arm using two glider lanes separated by <a href="#rdh">9hd</a>. By some
definitions, due to its limited one-dimensional growth pattern, the
linear propagator is not a true replicator. Compare

<p>:<b>line crosser</b> A pattern which is able to send a signal across an
infinite diagonal line of live cells without destroying the line.
David Bell built one in August 2006. It uses many one-shot period
44160 <a href="#y7q">glider guns</a> on both sides of the line having the proper
synchronization to create the reactions shown in
<a href="#lgd">line-cutting reaction</a> and <a href="#k12">line-mending reaction</a>.
<p>An input glider can arrive at any multiple of 44160 generations to
first cut the line, then send a glider through the gap, and finally
mend the line while leaving an output glider on the other side.
<p>A line crosser whose complete mechanism is on one side of the line
is theoretically possible, using <a href="#way">single-channel</a> construction
methods for example.
<p>:<a name=lgd><b>line-cutting reaction</b></a> A reaction that can cut an infinite diagonal
line of cells, leaving a gap with both ends sealed. Such a reaction
is demonstrated below. In actual use the reaction should be spread
out so that the incoming <a href="#gr9">LWSSes</a> don't conflict. See
<a href="#k12">line-mending reaction</a> for a way to mend the gap.

<p>This reaction uses spaceships on both sides of the line which need
to be synchronized to each other, for example by passing a glider
through the gap to trigger the creation of the required spaceships
and gliders.
<p>No simple mechanism is known to mend the gap which lies completely
on one side of the line. However, it is technically possible to use
<a href="#bwp">construction arm</a> <a href="#m30">technology</a> to push objects through the gap to
build and trigger a <a href="#fnr">seed</a> for the required <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> <a href="#j4d">signals</a>
on the other side.
<p>:<a name=et1><b>line puffer</b></a> A <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which produces its output by means of an
orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel.
The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994,
based on a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart.
The following month Holzwart found a way to make <a href="#dwr">extensible</a> <i>c</i>/2
line puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the
following day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large
widths these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions
of generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the
instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable
and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of
width, although neither of these things has been proved.
<p>Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult
periods for <i>c</i>/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally
periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be
impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a>. (See <a href="#y5g">frothing puffer</a> for another method of
constructing such periods.) In particular, the first <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#fnm">rake</a> with
period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when David
Bell constructed a p42 <a href="#cn0">backrake</a> by means of line puffers.

March 1999; this was <i>c</i>/12 and used <a href="#i53">switch engine</a> based puffers
found earlier by Dean Hickerson. The first <i>c</i>/4 example was found by
Hartmut Holzwart in November 2004.

The input shown here is a <a href="#yla">Herschel great-grandparent</a>, since the
input reaction is catalysed by the <a href="#o6q">transparent</a> block before the
Herschel's standard form can appear.
<p><a name=M>:</a><a name=xd9><b>macrocell</b></a> A format used by <a href="#s47">Golly</a> and its <a href="#dtq">hashlife</a> algorithm,
capable of storing repetitive patterns very efficiently, even if they
contain a large number of cells. For example, a filled square 2<sup>167</sup>
cells on a side can be stored in less than three kilobytes in
macrocell format, or about 800 bytes in compressed macrocell format.
The square's total population is over a googol, 10<sup>100</sup>; the number of
atoms in the observable universe is only about 10<sup>80</sup>.
<p>This high level of compression is obtained by defining a tree
structure composed of increasingly large cell "tiles" with
power-of-two dimensions. Tile definitions of any size are re-used
whenever they appear multiple times in a large pattern (at the same
power-of-two offset). For example, the following is a macrocell
encoding of a complex <a href="#sma">pseudo still life</a> arrangement of <a href="#ch9">ships</a>,
with a total population over 2500 cells:
<pre>
	[M2] (golly 3.0)
	#R B3/S23
	.OO.OO$O.O.O.O$OO...OO$$OO...OO$O.O.O.O$.OO.OO$
	4 0 1 1 1
	5 2 0 2 2
	6 3 3 0 3
	7 4 4 4 4
</pre>
<p>The first line after the #R rule line defines a quadtree tile at
the lowest level - a level-3 tile in this case, meaning a 2<sup>3</sup> square
area. At this level the pattern is encoded in a modified ASCII
format with dollar signs as line separators. The next line, #2,
defines a level-4 quadtree tile, made from one empty level-3 tile in
the northwest corner (0), and three copies of the level-3 tile that
was defined on the previous line (1). Lines 3, 4, and 5 similarly
define level 5, 6, and 7 quadtree tiles by giving the line numbers of
four tiles of the next lower size.
<p>Many patterns are only moderately repetitive, so macrocell format
is somewhat less successful at compressing them. Certainly most
patterns are not nearly as regular as the artificial example above:
there are usually many different tiles defined at each level, not
just one. Chaotic patterns, such as <a href="#fdc">ash</a> from random <a href="#dnq">soups</a>,
usually need so many different tile definitions that they can be
stored more efficiently using <a href="#bx2">rle</a> format.

<a href="#fq0">mosquito3</a>.
<p>Mosquito2 is very like <a href="#fpy">mosquito1</a>, but uses two fewer <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> and

<a href="#fq1">mosquito4</a>.
<p>Mosquito3 has one less <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> than <a href="#fpz">mosquito2</a>. It is somewhat
different from the earlier mosquitoes in that the <a href="#i53">switch engines</a> it

Silver produced in October 1998 making use of another discovery of
Nick Gotts (September 1997): an 8-cell pattern that evolves into a
<a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> plus some junk. Mosquito4 is a <a href="#q4w">breeder</a> with an initial
population of 73, at the time the smallest for any known pattern with

<p>:<a name=fq2><b>mosquito5</b></a> A slightly improved version of <a href="#fq1">mosquito4</a> which Nick Gotts
produced in October 1998. The improvement is of a similar nature to
the improvement of mosquito4 over mosquito3. Mosquito5 is a
<a href="#q4w">breeder</a> with an initial population of 71. This was the smallest
population for any known pattern with superlinear growth until it was
superseded by <a href="#b33">teeth</a>. See <a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a> for the

The edge shooter output at the top has no additional <a href="#ng0">clearance</a>, so
its use in creating <a href="#lx2">convoys</a> is limited: it can only add gliders on
the outermost lanes of an existing glider <a href="#i1v">salvo</a>. Like the beehive
version of <a href="#fxr">SW-2</a>, either output can be used to build logical OR
gates, where multiple input <a href="#j4d">signal</a> paths are merged onto the same
output path.
<p>The complete name for this converter is "NW31T120", where 31 is the
output glider lane number. In the above orientation, lane numbers
get bigger toward the upper right and smaller toward the lower left
(and may easily be negative).
<p>The T120 timing measurement means that a canonical NW glider placed
on lane 31 at time T=120, at (+31, +0) relative to the input
Herschel, would in theory reach the exact same spacetime locations as
the converter's output glider does.
<p>Most converters are not edge shooters and their output lanes are
not transparent, so they usually have catalysts that would interfere
with this theoretically equivalent glider. This is the case for the
optional third glider output created by the lower <a href="#uic">eater1</a> catalyst:
the upper eater1 overlaps its <a href="#aii">lane</a>. For the alternate <a href="#dp5">block</a>

<p>:<a name=nze><b>omniperiodic</b></a> A <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> is said to be omniperiodic if it
has <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of all <a href="#ve5">periods</a>. It is not known if Life is
omniperiodic, although this seems likely. Dave Buckingham's work on
Herschel conduits in 1996 (see
<a href="#cg9">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>) left only a short
list of unresolved cases, all with periods of 58 or below. The list
has been progressively reduced since then. Most recently, period 43
and 53 oscillators were made possible in 2013 by Mike Playle's
<a href="#wvr">Snark</a>. As of June 2018, no oscillators are known for periods 19,
23, 38, or 41. If we insist that the oscillator must be
<a href="#u4d">non-trivial</a>, then 34 should be added to this list.
<p>Note that if we were to allow infinite oscillators, then all
periods are certainly possible, as any period of 14 or more can be
obtained using a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> (or <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>) stream, or an infinitely long

<p>:<b>orphan</b> Conway's preferred term for a <a href="#h4h">Garden of Eden</a>. According to
some definitions, an orphan consists of just the minimum living and
dead cells needed to ensure that no parent is possible, whereas a GoE
is an entire infinite Life plane that contains an orphan.
<p>:<a name=gy6><b>Orthogonoid</b></a> (256<i>c</i>/3476016, p3476016) A <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a>
<a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> analogous to the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a>, with a slow orthogonal
direction of travel. The first example was completed by Dave Greene
on 29 June 2017, with a top speed of 16<i>c</i>/217251 (this is just
256<i>c</i>/3476016 in lowest terms).
<p>The construction recipe is a stream of MWSSes, with the recovery
time limited to 90 ticks by the <a href="#amz">Lx200</a> <a href="#dt1">dependent conduit</a> that
follows the initial <a href="#fzn">syringe</a> converter. The design is
<a href="#dtq">hashlife</a>-friendly, meaning that the spaceship can be trivially
adjusted so that spatial and temporal offsets are exact powers of
two; period 4194304 and period 8388608 versions have been
constructed, with speeds of <i>c</i>/16384 and <i>c</i>/32768 respectively.
<p>The MWSSes are converted to <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>, which produce a standard
<a href="#way">single-channel</a> glider stream that runs the Orthogonoid's single
construction arm. After the child circuitry is complete, a
previously constructed <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> in the parent is removed from the
construction arm lane, converting it to a "destruction arm" that
shoots down the previous constructor/reflector in the series.
<p>:<a name=nm7><b>oscillator</b></a> Any pattern that is a <a href="#mgk">predecessor</a> of itself. The term
is usually restricted to non-<a href="#qup">stable</a> finite patterns; period 1
oscillators are <a href="#qup">stable</a> and are usually just called <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a>.
The <a href="#i1p">blinker</a> is the smallest non-stable oscillator, having period 2.
There are oscillators of almost all higher periods (see
<a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>). In general <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> theory the term
"oscillator" usually covers <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> as well, but this usage is
not normal in Life.
<p>Oscillators consisting of separate objects which do not react in
any phase are usually ignored. For example, a separated <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>
and <a href="#sj5">pulsar</a> makes a period 6 oscillator, but is considered
<a href="#xdg">trivial</a>.
<p>An oscillator can be divided into a <a href="#mfj">rotor</a> and a <a href="#vf6">stator</a>, and the
stator can be further subdivided into <a href="#b95">bushing</a> and <a href="#io3">casing</a>. Some
oscillators have no casing cells, and a few 100%-<a href="#sqn">volatility</a>
oscillators also have no bushing cells.
<p>An oscillator can be constructed from any <a href="#xtd">gun</a> as long as <a href="#v1v">eaters</a>
can be added to consume its output. If it is a <a href="#w43">true</a> <a href="#xtd">gun</a> then the
period of the oscillator will be the same as the gun - unless the
eating mechanism multiplies the period, as in the case of gliders
caught by a <a href="#u19">boat-bit</a>.
<p>With the discovery of <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a>, <a href="#lqz">relays</a> provide an easy way to
create oscillators of all large periods. For example, eight gliders
travelling in a loop created by four <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a> can create any period
above 42, with a population never exceeding 356 live cells.
<p>For the very lowest periods, whole families of <a href="#dwr">extensible</a>
oscillators are known. Examples of this are <a href="#uwc">barberpole</a>, <a href="#r0a">cross</a>,
<a href="#p8a">pentoad</a>, <a href="#r2w">p6 shuttle</a>, <a href="#bia">snacker</a>, and <a href="#ytp">multiple roteightors</a>. Any
of the <a href="#nxo">shuttles</a> are oscillators by definition, for example the
<a href="#th5">queen bee shuttle</a>. Many of these are also extensible. Other
oscillators such as <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> and <a href="#cig">tumbler</a> have unique mechanisms
that are not part of an extended family.
<p>Some oscillators are useful because of the <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> they can
cause to other objects. This is especially true if they provide a
<a href="#eh8">spark</a> on their boundary. Some oscillators are explicitly found by
<a href="#reu">search programs</a> in order to produce these sparks, such as
<a href="#svd">pipsquirters</a>.
<p>Some higher period oscillators have been found while running random
<a href="#dnq">soups</a>. This is especially true if the soup is run on a cylindrical
or torus <a href="#hfc">universe</a>. Sometimes the found objects can be moved to the
normal universe and supported there by added <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>.
<a href="#v31">Achim's p144</a> is an example.
<p>:<a name=sy8><b>Osqrtlogt</b></a> (p1 circuitry) A pattern constructed by Adam P. Goucher in
2010, which uses an unbounded triangular region as memory for a
binary counter. Empty space is read as a zero, and a boat as a one,
as shown in the example pattern in <a href="#g5g">memory cell</a>. The pattern's
diametric growth rate is O(sqrt(log(<i>t</i>))), which is the slowest
possible for any Life pattern, or indeed any 2D Euclidean cellular
automaton. The population returns infinitely often to its initial
minimum value (during carry operations from 11111...1 to 100000...0,
so it can be considered to be an unusual form of <a href="#lge">sawtooth</a>.
<p>:<a name=bsm><b>OTCA metapixel</b></a> (p46 circuitry) A 2048 &times; 2048 period 35328 <a href="#xis">metacell</a>
constructed by Brice Due in 2006. It contains a large "pixel" area
that contains a large population of <a href="#gr9">LWSSes</a> when the metacell state
is ON, but is empty when it is OFF. This allows the state of the
metacell to be visible at high zoom levels, unlike previous
<a href="#ih8">unit cells</a> where the state was signaled by the presence or absence
of a single glider in a specific location.
<p>:<b>out of the blue</b> See <a href="#mx1">natural Heisenburp</a>. Other similar mechanisms,
particularly the method of <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> creation used in the pixel part of
the <a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a>, may also be referred to as "out of the blue"
reactions.
<p>:<a name=ds9><b>overclocking</b></a> A term used when a <a href="#tka">circuit</a> can accept a signal at a
specific period which it cannot accept at a higher period. A
<a href="#fzn">syringe</a> is a simple example.
<p>Some <a href="#u1r">staged recovery</a> circuits also permit overclocking, and can
function successfully at a rate faster than their <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a>. A
<a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a> has a recovery time of 497 ticks, but can be
overclocked to reflect a period 250 glider stream, or any nearby
period above 248, simply by removing a beehive after the first glider
enters the reflector. However, a continuous stream of gliders is
then required to maintain the circuit, with timing within a tightly
bounded range.
<p>:<b>overcrowding</b> = <a href="#wol">overpopulation</a>
<p>:<b>over-exposure</b> = <a href="#jco">underpopulation</a>
<p>:<a name=wol><b>overpopulation</b></a> Death of a cell caused by it having more than three
<a href="#t75">neighbours</a>. See also <a href="#jco">underpopulation</a>.
<p>:<b>over-unity reaction</b> An important concept in <a href="#xtd">gun</a> and
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a> construction. To be a good candidate for building
one of these types of patterns with a new period or speed, a
stationary reaction (for a gun) or a moving reaction (for a
macro-spaceship) must be able to produce some number of output
<a href="#j4d">signals</a>, strictly greater than the number of input signals required
to maintain the reaction. The extra signal becomes a gun's output
<a href="#goz">stream</a>, or may be used in a variety of ways to construct the
supporting <a href="#dgl">track</a> for a macro-spaceship. By implication,
"over-unity" refers to the ratio of output signals to input signals.
<p>If all signal outputs must be used up to sustain a stationary
reaction, a high-period <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> may still be possible. See
<a href="#ipa">emu</a> for example.
<p>:<b>overweight spaceship</b> = <a href="#w2q">OWSS</a>
<p>:<a name=w2q><b>OWSS</b></a> A would-be <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> similar to <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a>, <a href="#dfv">MWSS</a> and <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a> but
longer. On its own an OWSS is unstable, but it can be escorted by
true spaceships to form a <a href="#w4e">flotilla</a>.

<p><a name=P>:</a><b>p</b> = <a href="#ve5">period</a>
<p>:<a name=if5><b>p1</b></a> Period 1, i.e., <a href="#qup">stable</a>. In the context of logic <a href="#tka">circuitry</a>,
this tends to mean that a mechanism is constructed from
<a href="#j58">Herschel conduits</a> that contain only <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> as <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>.
In the context of <a href="#qtm">slow glider construction</a>, a P1 <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> is
one in which there are no constraints on the <a href="#u3g">parity</a> of gliders in
the salvo, because the <a href="#hyb">intermediate targets</a> are all stable
constellations. (The usual alternative is a "P2 slow salvo", where
the relative timing between adjacent gliders can be increased
arbitrarily, but only by multiples of two ticks.)
<p>:<b>p104 gun</b> A <a href="#y7q">glider gun</a> with period 104, found by Noam Elkies on 21

<p>:<a name=t7o><b>p1 megacell</b></a> (p1 circuitry) A <a href="#xis">metacell</a> constructed by Adam P.
Goucher in 2008, capable of being programmed to emulate any Moore
neighborhood rule, including isotropic and anisotropic non-totalistic
rules. It fits in a 32768 by 32768 bounding box, with the resulting
metacell grid at 45 degrees to the underlying Life grid. Like the
<a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a>, it includes a large "pixel" area so that the state
of the megacell can easily be seen even at extremely small-scale zoom
levels.
<p>:<a name=shf><b>p1 telegraph</b></a> (p1 circuitry) A variant of Jason Summers' <a href="#mzy">telegraph</a>
pattern, constructed in 2010 by Adam P. Goucher using only stable
circuitry. A single incoming glider produces the entire ten-part
composite lightspeed signal that restores the beehive-chain
<a href="#lip">lightspeed wire</a> to its original position. The signal is detected
at the other end of the telegraph and converted back into a single
output signal. This simplification came at the cost of a much slower
transmission speed, one bit per 91080 ticks. In this mechanism,
sending the entire ten-part signal constitutes a '1' bit, and not
sending the signal means '0'. See also <a href="#wak">high-bandwidth telegraph</a>.

<p>:<b>p4 reflector</b> The following <a href="#p9q">glider</a> <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>, discovered by Karel
Suhajda in October 2012. Its minimum repeat time is 52 ticks.
Unlike the various <a href="#uxt">bouncers</a> discovered many years earlier, it is a
<a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a> reflector, so it was made obsolete the following
year by the discovery of the much smaller stable <a href="#wvr">Snark</a>, which uses
the same initial <a href="#i1x">bait</a> reaction and so produces an output glider
with the same timing. For a smaller periodic <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a>
glider reflector with a different output timing, see <a href="#lu3">p4 bumper</a>.

There are several other ways to create a p60 gun from two p30 guns
using period-doubling reactions similar to the one shown here.
<p>:<a name=qna><b>p690 gun</b></a> A <a href="#w43">true</a> period 690 <a href="#p9q">glider</a> gun found by Noam Elkies in
July 1996. It is composed of a p30 <a href="#ix9">queen bee shuttle pair</a> and a
p46 <a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a> whose sparks occasionally react with each
other. This is a very compact gun for such a high period and is used
in many patterns requiring sparse glider streams.

<p>:<a name=pve><b>parent</b></a> A pattern is said to be a parent of the pattern it gives rise
to after one generation. Some patterns have infinitely many parents,
but others have none at all (see <a href="#h4h">Garden of Eden</a>). Typically
parents are considered trivial if they contain groups of cells that
can be removed without changing the result, such as isolated faraway
cells.
<p>:<a name=fjd><b>parent cells</b></a> The three cells that cause a new cell to be born.
<p>:<a name=u3g><b>parity</b></a> Even or odd, particularly as applied to the <a href="#kv9">phase</a> of an
oscillator or spaceship. For example, in <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> constructions,
the <a href="#hyb">intermediate targets</a> are frequently period 2, most often
because they contain <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a> or <a href="#ndw">traffic lights</a>. A glider
striking a P2 constellation will generally produce a different result
depending on its parity. Period-4 intermediate targets are rare (or
not used), so it doesn't matter for example whether an odd-parity
glider in a slow salvo is phase 1 or phase 3. Only the even/odd
parity is important.
<p>:<a name=p65><b>partial result</b></a> An intermediate object found by a <a href="#reu">search program</a>
which might be a substantial part of a complete <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> or
<a href="#nm7">oscillator</a>, but which isn't complete.
<p>Running a partial result works for a few generations until the
<a href="#ups">speed of light</a> corruption from any unfinished edge destroys the
whole object. But a partial result can still be used to see whether
the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired <a href="#eh8">spark</a> or
<a href="#eir">perturbation</a>. If no partial results are found then it is likely
that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.
<p>Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance
that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is
no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a
base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search
area, or splitting the object into multiple <a href="#fas">arms</a> might result in
finding a complete working object.
<p>As an example, here is a large partial result for a period 6
<a href="#nl7">knightship</a> found by Josh Ball in April 2017. The first 22 columns
were rediscovered in 2018 as part of the successful search for
<a href="#c8a">Sir Robin</a>. See also <a href="#ioy">almost knightship</a> for an earlier small
example by Eugene Langvagen.

<p>:<a name=b5p><b>pentomino</b></a> Any 5-cell <a href="#ml6">polyomino</a>. There are 12 such patterns, and
Conway assigned them all letters in the range O to Z, loosely based
on their shapes. Only in the case of the <a href="#rax">R-pentomino</a> has Conway's
label remained in common use, but all of them can nonetheless be
found in this lexicon.
<p>:<a name=ve5><b>period</b></a> The smallest number of generations it takes for an
<a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> to reappear in its original form. The
term can also be used for a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>, <a href="#vac">wick</a>, <a href="#odj">fuse</a>, <a href="#rft">superstring</a>,
stream of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, <a href="#wle">factory</a> or <a href="#xtd">gun</a>. In the last case there
is a distinction between <a href="#w43">true</a> period and <a href="#rqv">pseudo</a> period. There is
also a somewhat different concept of period for <a href="#jw0">wicktrailers</a>.
<p>:<a name=t6w><b>period doubler</b></a> See <a href="#b79">period multiplier</a>.
<p>:<a name=we8><b>periodic</b></a> For <a href="#tka">circuit</a> mechanisms, "periodic" is the opposite of <a href="#if5">p1</a>
or <a href="#qup">stable</a>. Periodic <a href="#tka">circuits</a> necessarily contain <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>,
and therefore they can generally only accept input <a href="#j4d">signals</a> that are
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> to the combined <a href="#ve5">period</a> of those oscillators (but see
<a href="#ama">universal regulator</a>).
<p>For <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#goz">streams</a>, "periodic" means that signals will only be
present in the stream at one out of every <i>n</i> ticks, where <i>n</i> is the
<a href="#ve5">period</a> of the stream. In a periodic <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> there
may be gaps, so that signals do not always appear at every nth tick.
However, if a signal does appear, its distance measured in ticks from
previous and future signals will always be an exact multiple of <i>n</i>.
<p>:<a name=b79><b>period multiplier</b></a> A term commonly used for a <a href="#xge">pulse divider</a>, because
dividing the number of <a href="#j4d">signals</a> in a regular stream by <i>N</i> necessarily
multiplies the <a href="#ve5">period</a> by <i>N</i>. The term "period multiplier" can be
somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can
accept input streams that are not strictly <a href="#we8">periodic</a>.
<p>Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple
the output of some <a href="#fnm">rakes</a> to create high-period rakes in a
relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a
linear increase in size).
<p>For <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> signals and <a href="#y7q">glider guns</a>, a number of small period
doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example,
the following <a href="#u15">conduit</a> produces one output glider after accepting
four input <a href="#saf">B-heptominoes</a>, or four Herschels if a conduit such as
<a href="#awm">F117</a> is prepended that includes the same <a href="#rlx">BFx59H</a> converter.

restore the circuit to its original function.

perform a simple <a href="#gvu">block pull</a> that switches off an <a href="#ba2">F166</a> conduit, so
that any future Herschel inputs will be cleanly absorbed. A glider
from the southwest (also shown) can restore the block to its original

<p>:<a name=kv9><b>phase</b></a> A representative generation of a periodic object such as an
<a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. The number of phases is equal to the
<a href="#ve5">period</a> of the object. The phases of an object usually repeat in
the same cyclic sequence forever, although some <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> can
cause a <a href="#op2">phase change</a>.
<p>:<a name=op2><b>phase change</b></a> A <a href="#eir">perturbation</a> of a periodic object that causes the
object to skip forward or backward by one or more <a href="#kv9">phases</a>. If the
perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change
the <a href="#ve5">period</a> of the object. An example of this, found by Dean
Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the
period of the <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> would be 7 if the <a href="#wvn">mold</a> were removed, but
the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes
caused by the mold's <a href="#eh8">spark</a>.

Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000,
Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix.
The situation for higher periods is unknown.
<p>An easy <a href="#or5">synthesis</a> of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as
<a href="#fnr">seeds</a>. A <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> creating a growing row of phoenixes has the
unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive
for more than one generation approaches zero. See <a href="#ngr">lone dot agar</a>

<p>:<a name=igp><b>pi</b></a> = <a href="#se4">pi-heptomino</a>
<p>:<a name=ylp><b>Pianola breeder</b></a> A series of patterns by Paul Tooke in 2010, based on
a simplification and extension of the <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship's
construction mechanism. Tooke produced a number of
slow-salvo-constructed patterns with <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>, including
a series of breeder patterns of previously unknown types. For some
patterns, the Gemini's two <a href="#bwp">construction arms</a> were moved to a
permanent stationary platform, using fourteen glider-loop channels
instead of twelve.
<p>Some of these breeder patterns remain difficult to classify
unambiguously. For example, one pattern was designed to be an MSS
breeder - a modified <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> spaceship puffing <a href="#q3g">slide guns</a> which
build lines of <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>. However, the slide guns produce both moving
and stationary objects at a linear rate, because streams of gliders
are needed to reach out to the construction zone to do the <a href="#gh5">push</a>
reaction and build more blocks. The pattern could therefore be
classified as a hybrid MSM/MSS breeder. Other breeder patterns
utilizing slide guns and <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> technology are
likely to cause similar classification ambiguities.
<p>:<a name=sd7><b>pi calculator</b></a> (p1 circuitry) A device constructed by Adam P. Goucher
in February 2010, which calculates the decimal digits of pi (the
transcendental number, not the Life pattern!) and displays them in
the Life universe as 8&times;10 dot matrix characters formed by
arrangements of blocks along a diagonal stripe at the top. A <a href="#gh5">push</a>
reaction moves a ten-block diagonal cursor to the next position as
part of the "printing" operation for each new digit.
<p>The actual calculation is done in binary, using a streaming spigot
algorithm based on linear fractional transformations. The pi
calculator is made up of a 188-state computer connected to a printing
device via period-8 <a href="#dkj">regulators</a> and a binary-to-decimal conversion
mechanism. The complete pattern can be found in <a href="#s47">Golly</a>'s Very Large
Patterns online archive, along with the very similar 177-state phi
calculator which uses a simpler algorithm to calculate and print the
Golden Ratio.
<p>:<a name=kk7><b>pi climber</b></a> The reaction that defines rate of travel of the

"climbing" a chain of blinkers, moving 17 cells every 45 ticks, and
leaving behind an identical chain of blinkers, shifted downward by 6
cells. A single pi climber does not produce any gliders or other
output, but two or more of them travelling on nearby blinker chains
can be arranged to emit gliders every 45 ticks. Compare
<a href="#xit">Herschel-pair climber</a>.

<p>:<a name=ml6><b>polyomino</b></a> A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The
mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb in
1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular
automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes, this
being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of
different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved by
hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special
significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early
years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced
the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes" the
plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have
followed Golomb in using the longer form.)
<p>It is possible for a polyomino to be an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a>. In fact
there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the
<a href="#r0a">cross</a> and its larger analogues. The only other known examples are
the <a href="#dp5">block</a>, the <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>, the <a href="#y3s">toad</a>, the <a href="#n70">star</a> and (in two
different phases) the <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a>.

instead a fraction of <i>n</i>, then a <a href="#b79">period multiplier</a> must also be
present which is considered to be part of the mechanism, and the gun
as a whole is still a true period gun. For example, a <a href="#dhf">filter</a> may
be used on a lower-period gun to produce a compound gun such as the
true <a href="#jrz">p48 gun</a>.
<p>Pseudo period <i>n</i> glider guns are known to exist for all periods
greater than or equal to 14, with smaller periods being impossible.
All known <a href="#rzk">p14 guns</a> are pseudo guns requiring several <a href="#j4d">signal</a>
<a href="#aob">injections</a>, so they are quite large. The following smaller example
is a pseudo period 123 gun, interleaving the streams from two true
period 246 guns:

<p>:<a name=lxa><b>pseudo-random glider generator</b></a> A <a href="#lpw">pseudo-random number generator</a> in
which the bits are represented by the presence or absence of
<a href="#p9q">gliders</a>. The first pseudo-random glider generator was built by
Bill Gosper. David Bell built the first moving one in 1997, using
<i>c</i>/3 <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>.
<p>:<a name=lpw><b>pseudo-random number generator</b></a> A pseudo-random number generator
(PRNG) is an algorithm that produces a sequence of bits that looks
random (but cannot really be random, being algorithmically
determined).
<p>In Life, the term refers to a PRNG implemented as a Life pattern,
with the bits represented by the presence or absence of objects such
as <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>. Such a PRNG usually contains gliders or
other <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> in a loop with a feedback mechanism that causes
later spaceships to interfere with the generation of earlier
spaceships. The <a href="#ve5">period</a> can be very high, as a loop of <i>n</i> spaceships
has 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> possible states.
<p>:<a name=sma><b>pseudo still life</b></a> A <a href="#qup">stable</a> pattern whose live cells are either
immediately adjacent to each other, or are connected into a single
group by adjacent dead cells where birth is suppressed by
overpopulation.
<p>The definition of <a href="#rxv">strict still life</a> rules out such stable
patterns as the <a href="#fk0">bi-block</a>. In such patterns there are dead cells
which have more than 3 neighbours in total, but fewer than 3 in any
component still life. These patterns are called pseudo still lifes,
and have been enumerated up to 32 bits, as shown in the table below.

<p>Attribution of these counts is given in <a href="#rxv">strict still life</a>; see
also <a href="https://oeis.org/A056613">https://oeis.org/A056613</a>. The unique 32-bit <a href="#f6b">triple pseudo</a>
still life is included in the last count in the table. As the number
of bits increases, the pseudo still life count goes up exponentially
by approximately O(2.56<sup><i>n</i></sup>). By comparison, the rate for
<a href="#rxv">strict still lifes</a> is about O(2.46<sup><i>n</i></sup>) while for <a href="#epc">quasi still lifes</a>
it's around O(3.04<sup><i>n</i></sup>).
<p>If a stable pattern's live cells plus its overpopulated dead cells
do not form a single mutually adjacent group, the pattern is usually
referred to as a <a href="#th3">constellation</a>. It is also a <a href="#gt3">still life</a> in the
general sense, but is neither "pseudo" nor "strict".
<p>:<a name=u5t><b>puffer</b></a> An object that moves like a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, except that it leaves
debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and
travelled at <i>c</i>/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very first
one, found in 1971).

<p>Not long afterwards <i>c</i>/12 diagonal puffers were found (see
<a href="#i53">switch engine</a>). Discounting <a href="#b97">wickstretchers</a>, which are not
puffers in the conventional sense, no new velocity was obtained after
this until David Bell found the first <i>c</i>/3 orthogonal puffer in April
1996. Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years.
<p>Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than <i>c</i>/2
have useful side or back <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>. These can be used to perturb
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceships</a> that approach from behind. A common technique
for creating puffers for a new speed uses a <a href="#lx2">convoy</a> of the new
spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship
such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as
the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a
high-period puffer for the new speed.
<p>As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known
velocity of <a href="#abo">elementary</a> spaceship, except for <i>c</i>/6 and <i>c</i>/7 diagonal
and (2,1)<i>c</i>/6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>, simply by removing some part of the trailing
cleanup mechanism.
<p>:<a name=j2v><b>puffer engine</b></a> A pattern which can be used as the main component of a
<a href="#u5t">puffer</a>. The pattern may itself be a puffer (e.g. the classic
<a href="#eth">puffer train</a>), it may be a spaceship (e.g. the <a href="#npa">Schick engine</a>), or
it may even be unstable (e.g. the <a href="#i53">switch engine</a>).
<p>:<a name=x7i><b>pufferfish</b></a> (<i>c</i>/2, p12) A puffer discovered by Richard Schank in
November 2014, from a symmetric soup search using an early version of
<a href="#uj4">apgsearch</a>. It consists of a pair of <a href="#saf">B-heptominoes</a> stabilised by
a backend that leaves only pairs of blocks behind. It is simple
enough to be easily synthesized with gliders.

<p>:<a name=yli><b>pufferfish spaceship</b></a> (<i>c</i>/2, p36) Generally, any <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>

2014, the first such spaceship to contain no period-2 or period-4
parts. (The first two or three rows might be considered to be period
2 or 4, but they are directly dependent on following rows for
support.).
<p>The pattern consists of two adjacent <a href="#x7i">pufferfish</a> <a href="#u5t">puffers</a>, plus
four copies of a nontrivial period 36 <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#odj">fuse</a> for pufferfish

<p>:<a name=eth><b>puffer train</b></a> The full name for a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>, coined by Conway before
any examples were known. The term was also applied specifically to
the classic puffer train found by Bill Gosper and shown below. This
is very <a href="#yx7">dirty</a>, and the tail does not stabilize until generation
5533. It consists of a <a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a> (shown here one generation

<p>:<a name=ki0><b>puff suppressor</b></a> An attachment at the back of a <a href="#et1">line puffer</a> that
suppresses all or some of its puffing action. The example below (by
Hartmut Holzwart) has a 3-cell puff suppressor at the back which
suppresses the entire puff, making a p2 <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. If you delete
this puff suppressor then you get a p60 double <a href="#ktx">beehive</a> <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>.
Puff suppressors were first recognised by Alan Hensel in April 1994.

<p>:<b>pulse</b> A moving object, such as a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> or <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>, which can

<p>Also another name for a <a href="#a9h">pulsar quadrant</a>.
<p>:<a name=xge><b>pulse divider</b></a> A mechanism that lets every <i>n</i>-th object that reaches it
pass through, and deletes all the rest, where <i>n</i> &gt; 1 and the objects
are typically <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>, <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> or <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>. A common
synonym is <a href="#b79">period multiplier</a>. For <i>n</i>=2, the simplest known stable
pulse dividers are the <a href="#ss2">semi-Snarks</a>.
<p>The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter
Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block
and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will
not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original
position. The relatively small size and low period of this example
made it useful for constructing compact glider <a href="#xtd">guns</a> of certain
periods, but it became largely obsolete with the discovery of the
<a href="#qup">stable</a> <a href="#h5l">CC semi-Snark</a>, which uses the same basic mechanism.
Period 7, 22, 36 and 46 versions of this pulse divider are also
known.

<p>:<a name=a9e><b>quad pseudo</b></a> A <a href="#gt3">still life</a> that can be broken down into four <a href="#qup">stable</a>

following 34-bit pattern, found by Gabriel Nivasch in July 2001, or
any similar pattern with the same property.

<p>As a consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, there can be no
analogous objects requiring decomposition into five or more pieces.
By convention, patterns like this and the <a href="#f6b">triple pseudo</a> are
considered to be <a href="#sma">pseudo still lifes</a>, not <a href="#rxv">strict still lifes</a>. As
of June 2018, it has been shown that no quad pseudo patterns exist
with 32 or fewer bits, but a 33-bit pattern with this property may
theoretically still be found.
<p>:<a name=qrq><b>quadratic filter</b></a> A <a href="#uxc">toolkit</a> developed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel
Nivasch in 2006, enabling the construction of patterns with
asymptotic population growth matching an infinite number of different
sublinear functions - namely, O(<i>t</i><sup><i>(</i></sup>1/2<sup><i>n</i></sup>)) for any chosen <i>n</i>. See
also <a href="#k47">exponential filter</a>, <a href="#ahl">recursive filter</a>.
<p>:<a name=l9c><b>quadratic growth</b></a> The fastest possible asymptotic rate of population
growth for any Life pattern - O(<i>t</i><sup>2</sup>) in big-O notation, where <i>t</i> is
the number of ticks. The first quadratic-growth pattern found was
Bill Gosper's 1971 <a href="#q4w">breeder</a>. Many other types of breeders and
<a href="#yq2">spacefillers</a> have been constructed since.
<p>In April 2011, Stephen Silver gave an example of a one-cell-thick
pattern over a million cells long that exhibited quadratic growth.
In October 2015, Chris Cain constructed a one-cell-thick pattern with
a reduced bounding box of 2596&times;1, improving on a series of previous
longer results. The smallest known quadratic growth pattern by
initial population is the 23-cell <a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a> by
Michael Simkin.
<p>There are an infinite number of possible growth rates between
linear and quadratic growth. See <a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>.
<p>:<a name=v7t><b>quadratic replicator</b></a> A pattern that fills all or part of the Life
plane by making copies of itself in a nonlinear way. Small quadratic
replicators are known in other Life-like rules, but as of July 2018
no example has been found or constructed in Conway's Life.
<p>:<b>quadratic sawtooth</b> Any <a href="#lge">sawtooth</a> pattern with a quadratic envelope,
or specifically a pattern assembled by Martin Grant in May 2015,
consisting of two <a href="#tyd">caber tossers</a> with period multipliers for timing
which activate and deactivate two toggleable rake guns (see
<a href="#ftm">toggleable gun</a>). The gliders emitted by those rakes annihilate on
the diagonal while the rakes are eaten by 2<i>c</i>/5 ships. All the rakes
and gliders are destroyed before the next cycle. See also
<a href="#sy8">Osqrtlogt</a>.
<p>:<a name=af8><b>quadri-Snark</b></a> A period-multiplying <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a> <a href="#j4d">signal</a>
<a href="#u15">conduit</a> found by Tanner Jacobi in October 2017, producing one
output <a href="#p9q">glider</a> for every four input gliders. It is made by
replacing one of the eaters in a <a href="#k3s">tremi-Snark</a> with a <a href="#k63">catalyst</a>
found using <a href="#dmj">Bellman</a>. The catalyst causes the formation of a <a href="#r3y">tub</a>
which then requires an additional glider to delete. However, this
adds 5 ticks to the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. If period
quadrupling is needed with a <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> reaction, a
<a href="#tg3">CP semi-Snark</a> and a <a href="#h5l">CC semi-Snark</a> can be used in series, or a
period-multiplying <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> can be connected to a <a href="#fzn">syringe</a>
and an appropriately chosen Herschel-to-glider <a href="#gra">converter</a>.

<p>:<a name=wls><b>Quetzal</b></a> Any Herschel track-based gun with a period below 62, which is
the lowest period with a stable glider-emitting conduit. This was
Dieter Leithner's name for the <a href="#w43">true</a> p54 glider gun he built in
January 1998 - a short form of <a href="#t82">Quetzalcoatlus</a>, which expresses the
fact that the gun was a very large <a href="#rmc">Herschel loop</a> that was not an
<a href="#ipa">emu</a>. Shortly afterwards Leithner also built a p56 Quetzal using a
mechanism found by Noam Elkies for this purpose. In October 1998
Stephen Silver constructed a p55 Quetzal using Elkies' p5 <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>
of the previous month. Quetzals of periods 57-61 have since been
constructed.
<p>Some of the more recent Quetzals are not Herschel loops, but are
instead short Herschel tracks firing several glider streams all but
one of which is reflected back to the beginning of the track to
create a new Herschel. Noam Elkies first had the idea of doing this
for the p55 case, and Stephen Silver constructed the resulting gun
shortly after building the original (much larger) p55 Quetzal. Jason
Summers later built a p54 version, which is more complicated because
the evenness of the period makes the timing problems considerably
more difficult.
<p>:<a name=t82><b>Quetzalcoatlus</b></a> A giant flying dinosaur after which Dieter Leithner

<p>:<b>racetrack</b> A pattern in which a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> makes its way in a loop
through an "obstacle course" of reactions in order to demonstrate
various ways that the signal can be reflected, temporarily stored,
and converted. The more different reactions that are used the better
the racetrack. David Goodenough built racetracks for p30 and p46
<a href="#m30">technology</a> in 1995. Racetracks are also known for
<a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> <a href="#m30">technology</a>, and simple ones are useful for
building <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> and <a href="#y7q">glider guns</a>.
<p>:<a name=fnm><b>rake</b></a> Any <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> whose debris consists of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>. A rake is
said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction
of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally
the term "rake" was applied only to forwards <i>c</i>/2 glider puffers (see
<a href="#af3">space rake</a>). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case
where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the
puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region
of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers
cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a
<a href="#xtd">gun</a>).
<p>Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were <i>c</i>/2, rakes of other
velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of
<a href="#we6">Corderships</a> in 1991 made it easy for <i>c</i>/12 diagonal rakes to be
built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time
David Bell had constructed <i>c</i>/3 and <i>c</i>/5 rakes (May 1996 and September
1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2<i>c</i>/5 rake in June
2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a <i>c</i>/4
orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found by
David Bell).
<p>The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this
could be achieved by a 3<i>c</i>/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The
smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers' <a href="#cn0">backrake</a>,
March 2001).

<p>:<a name=ok4><b>reaction envelope</b></a> The collection of <a href="#iq4">cells</a> that are alive during

<p>Reanimation of a <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> is used many times in the <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>.
It is also used in the <a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> as part of its <a href="#j46">catch and throw</a>
mechanism. Finally, reanimation can produce <a href="#fnm">rakes</a> from some
<a href="#u5t">puffers</a>. See <a href="#a1m">stop and restart</a> for a similar idea that applies to
<a href="#j58">Herschel conduits</a> and other <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#tka">circuitry</a>.
<p>There are small objects which have no known reanimation reactions
using <i>c</i>/2 ships other than the brute force method of hitting them
with the output of <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>.
<p>:<a name=ekr><b>reburnable fuse</b></a> A very rare type of <a href="#odj">fuse</a> whose output is identical
to its input, possibly with some spatial and/or temporal offset. See
<a href="#lip">lightspeed wire</a> for an example. Reburnable fuses are used
primarily in the construction of fixed-speed <a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a>
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>, where the speed of the fuse's burning reaction
becomes the speed of the spaceship. Examples include the
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a>, <a href="#qyv">Centipede</a>, and <a href="#jbk">waterbear</a>.
<p>:<a name=r79><b>receiver</b></a> See <a href="#wii">Herschel receiver</a>.
<p>:<a name=o36><b>recipe</b></a> = <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a> or <a href="#eh7">construction recipe</a>.
<p>:<a name=nc2><b>recovery time</b></a> The number of <a href="#fyw">ticks</a> that must elapse after a <a href="#j4d">signal</a>
is sent through a <a href="#u15">conduit</a>, before another signal can be safely sent
on the same path. In general, a lower recovery time means a more
useful conduit. For example, the <a href="#wvr">Snark</a>'s very low recovery time
allowed for the creation of <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> with previously unknown
<a href="#ve5">periods</a>, 43 and 53.
<p>For the most part this is a synonym for <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a>. However,
<a href="#ds9">overclocking</a> a complex circuit can often allow it to be used at a
<a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> much lower than its safe recovery time.
<p>:<a name=h8b><b>rectifier</b></a> The smallest known 180-degree <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>, discovered by
Adam P. Goucher in 2009. It was the smallest and fastest stable
reflector of any kind until the discovery of the <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> in 2013. The
rectifier has the same output glider as the <a href="#kgq">boojum reflector</a> but a
much shorter <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> of only 106 ticks.
<p>Another advantage of the rectifier is that the output glider is on
a <a href="#qgn">transparent lane</a>, so it can be used in logic circuitry to merge
two signal paths.

<p>:<a name=ahl><b>recursive filter</b></a> A <a href="#uxc">toolkit</a> developed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015,
which enables the construction of patterns with population growth
that asymptotically matches an infinite number of different
superlinear functions. Toolkits enabling other, sublinear infinite
series had been completed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in
2006. See <a href="#qrq">quadratic filter</a> and <a href="#k47">exponential filter</a>.
<p>Sublinear functions are possible using the recursive-filter toolkit
as well. It can be used to construct a glider-emitting pattern with
a slowness rate <i>S</i>(<i>t</i>) = O(log***...*(<i>t</i>)), the nth-level iterated
logarithm of <i>t</i>, which asymptotically dominates any
primitive-recursive function f(<i>t</i>).
<p>:<a name=vj8><b>reflector</b></a> Any <a href="#qup">stable</a> or oscillating pattern that can reflect some
type of <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> (usually a <a href="#p9q">glider</a>) without suffering permanent
damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection
process is generally called a <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> <a href="#z8l">turner</a> instead.
<p>The first known reflector was the <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlon</a>, which functions
as a 180-degree glider reflector (see <a href="#lqz">relay</a>). Other examples
include the <a href="#xgx">buckaroo</a>, the <a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a> and some oscillators
based on the <a href="#z87">traffic jam</a> reaction. Glider <a href="#xtd">guns</a> can also be made
into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.
<p>In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider
reflectors, with <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> supplying the required <a href="#sjt">domino</a>
<a href="#eh8">sparks</a> at different periods. A <a href="#u9e">figure-8</a> produced a <a href="#ori">p8 bouncer</a>,
and a <a href="#d06">p6 pipsquirter</a> produced an equivalent <a href="#y31">p6 bouncer</a>. A more
complicated construction allows a <a href="#q3y">p5 bouncer</a> (which, as had been
anticipated, soon led to a <a href="#w43">true</a> p55 <a href="#wls">Quetzal</a> gun). And in August
1999 Elkies found a suitable <a href="#uyk">sparker</a> to produce a <a href="#gsf">p7 bouncer</a>,
allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.
<p>These were all called simply "p5 reflector", "p6 reflector", etc.,
until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and
simple reaction, the <a href="#onm">bumper</a>, starting with a <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> as <a href="#i1x">bait</a>
instead of a <a href="#i0n">boat</a>. This resulted in a series of periodic
<a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a> reflectors, whereas Elkies' <a href="#uxt">bouncer</a> reflectors
are all <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a>. A useful mnemonic is that "bouncer"
contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas "bumper" contains a P
and is colour-preserving.
<p>Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain
conditions they can be used to construct <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> of all
sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable
reflectors were possible (see <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>), but no one
was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so
in October 1996.
<p>Callahan's original reflector has a <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> of 4840, soon
improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean
Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave
Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different
method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a
method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced
this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by
Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.
<p>In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with
a repeat time of only 202 (see <a href="#kgq">boojum reflector</a>). This reflector
won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the
prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree
reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a>
<a href="#wvr">Snark</a> reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable
reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100
prize for a <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> stable reflector contained within a 25
by 25 <a href="#p6q">bounding box</a>, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.
<p>As of June 2018, the following <a href="#s1s">splitter</a> is among the smallest
known 90-degree <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a>. The top output can
be blocked off by an <a href="#v1v">eater</a> if needed. For small 180-degree
colour-changing reflectors see <a href="#h8b">rectifier</a>, and also the sample
pattern in <a href="#s1s">splitter</a>.

<p>:<a name=ljz><b>reflectorless rotating oscillator</b></a> A pattern that rotates itself 90 or
180 degrees after some number of <a href="#tgp">generations</a>, with the additional
constraint that multiple non-interacting copies of the pattern can be
combined into a new oscillator with a period equal to the appropriate
fraction of the component oscillators' period. The second constraint
disqualifies small time-symmetric <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> such as the <a href="#i1p">blinker</a>
and <a href="#ylm">monogram</a>.
<p>A working RRO might look something like a <a href="#lvm">pi orbital</a> or
<a href="#l61">p256 gun</a> loop containing one or more <a href="#igp">pis</a> or <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a> in the
same loop, but without any external stabilisation mechanism. Such
patterns can be proven to exist (see <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>), but as
of June 2018 none have been explicitly constructed in Life. There is
no upper limit on <a href="#md0">multiplicity</a> for a constructor-based RRO.
<p>:<a name=dkj><b>regulator</b></a> An object which converts input <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> aligned to some
period to output gliders aligned to a different period. The most
interesting case is a <a href="#ama">universal regulator</a>, of which several have
been constructed by Paul Chapman and others.
<p>:<a name=lqz><b>relay</b></a> Any <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> in which <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> (typically <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>)
travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below
using two <a href="#mfb">pentadecathlons</a>. Pulling the pentadecathlons further
apart allows any period of the form 60+120<i>n</i> to be achieved. This is
the simplest proof of the existence of oscillators of arbitrarily
large period.

<p>:<b>repeater</b> Any <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>.
<p>:<a name=lhp><b>repeat time</b></a> The minimum number of generations that is possible
between the arrival of one object and the arrival of the next. This
term is used for things such as <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a> or <a href="#u15">conduits</a> where the
<a href="#j4d">signal</a> objects (<a href="#p9q">gliders</a> or <a href="#e7u">Herschels</a>, for example) will
interact fatally with each other if they are too close together, or
one will interact fatally with a disturbance caused by the other.
For example, the repeat time of Dave Buckingham's 59-step B-heptomino
to Herschel conduit (shown under <a href="#u15">conduit</a>) is 58.

<p>:<a name=dzz><b>replicator</b></a> A finite pattern which repeatedly creates copies of
itself. Such objects are known to exist (see
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>), but no concrete example is known. The
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a> may be considered to be the first example of a
replicator built in Life, but this is debatable as each of its copies
replicates itself only once, allowing no possibility of
<a href="#kij">superlinear growth</a>.
<p>:<a name=sh6><b>reverse caber tosser</b></a> A storage mechanism for data feeding a
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> designed by Adam P. Goucher in 2018. A very
large integer can be encoded in the position of a very faraway
object. If the distance to that object is measured using <a href="#tka">circuitry</a>
designed to be as simple as possible, a complete decoder and
universal constructor can be created by colliding a small number of
gliders - no more than 329 according to a June 2018
<a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>, and exactly 43 according to a July 1 redesign by
Chris Cain using eight far-distant <a href="#x1u">GPSEs</a> and, amazingly, no
stationary circuitry except for a single <a href="#k63">catalyst</a> <a href="#dp5">block</a>. Some
intermediate designs with 50+ gliders need no stationary circuitry at
all.
<p>With the correct placement of the faraway object, the complete
pattern is theoretically capable of building any glider-constructible
object. This means that 43 is the maximum number of gliders required
to build any constructible object, no matter what size. However, it
is not possible to determine in practice what the locations of these
43 gliders should be, even for a relatively simple construction.

<p>:<a name=bx2><b>rle</b></a> Run-length encoded. Run-length encoding is a simple (but not
very efficient) method of file compression. In Life the term refers
to a specific ASCII encoding used for patterns in Conway's Life and
other similar cellular automata. This encoding was introduced by
Dave Buckingham and is now the usual means of exchanging relatively
small patterns by email or in online forum discussions.
<p>As an example of the rle format, here is a representation of the
<a href="#mp9">Gosper glider gun</a>. The "run lengths" are the numbers, b's are dead
cells, o's are live cells, and dollar signs signal new lines:

</pre>
<p>Over the years RLE format has been extended to handle patterns with
multiple states, neighborhoods, rules, and universe sizes. A
completely different encoding, <a href="#xd9">macrocell</a> format, is used for
repetitive patterns that may have very large <a href="#n9e">populations</a>.

The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun
collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where <a href="#fzn">syringes</a>
can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion
reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another
glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the
perpendicular glider output is suppressed.)

At generation 774, an R-pentomino produces a <a href="#sxo">queen bee</a> which lasts
17 more generations before being destroyed, enough time for it to
flip over. This observation led to the discovery of the

<p>:<a name=i1v><b>salvo</b></a> A collection of spaceships, usually gliders, all travelling in
the same direction. Any valid glider construction <a href="#o36">recipe</a> can be
partitioned into no more than four salvos. Compare <a href="#w4e">flotilla</a>. In
contrast with a <a href="#lx2">convoy</a>, the spaceships in a salvo are usually
consumed by the reactions that they cause. Simple examples include
<a href="#smz">block pusher</a> and <a href="#gvu">block pull</a>.
<p>Salvos may be <a href="#gpd">slow</a> or <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a>. The following partially
<a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> three-glider salvo produces an <a href="#gr9">LWSS</a> from a block.

The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the
second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown.
The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it
will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many <a href="#fyw">ticks</a> it is
delayed. The <a href="#qtm">slow glider construction</a> entry includes an example of
a true slow salvo.
<p>:<a name=lge><b>sawtooth</b></a> Any finite pattern whose <a href="#n9e">population</a> grows without bound
but does not tend to infinity. (In other words, the population
reaches new heights infinitely often, but also infinitely often
returns to some fixed value.) Conway's preferred plural is
"sawteeth".
<p>The first sawtooth was constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991.
The current smallest known sawtooth was found by a conwaylife.com
forum user with the online handle 'thunk'. It has a bounding box of
74&times;60, and is the smallest known sawtooth in terms of its minimum
repeating population of 177 cells. The following variant has a higher
repeating population of 194 and an optimized bounding box of 62&times;56:

<p>:<a name=reu><b>search program</b></a> A computer program or script that automates the search
for Life objects having certain desired properties. These are used
because the difficulty of finding previously unknown Life objects now
commonly exceeds the patience, speed, and accuracy of humans.
Various types of search programs are used for finding objects such as
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a>, <a href="#v8p">drifters</a>, <a href="#k63">catalysts</a>, <a href="#dnq">soups</a>,
<a href="#h4h">Gardens of Eden</a>, and <a href="#rti">slow salvos</a>.
<p>Some search programs generate <a href="#p65">partial results</a> as they are
running, so even if they don't complete successfully, something of
use might still be salvaged from the run.
<p>Example search programs are <a href="#hkm">dr</a>, <a href="#tm4">lifesrc</a>, <a href="#ojz">gfind</a>, and
<a href="#dmj">Bellman</a>.
<p>There are other types of programs which don't perform searches as
such, but instead perform large constructions. These are used to
correctly complete very complicated objects such as the
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a>, <a href="#vke">Gemini</a>, <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>, and
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>-based spaceships such as the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a> and
<a href="#gy6">Orthogonoids</a>.
<p>:<b>second glider domain</b> The second glider domain of an <a href="#he2">edge shooter</a> is
the set of spacetime offsets, relative to the <a href="#p9q">glider</a> <a href="#goz">stream</a>
emitted by the edge shooter, where a second independent glider stream
may be present without interfering with the edge shooter. This is
useful to know, because edge shooters are often used to generate
glider streams very close to other glider streams, to make for
example a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> <a href="#xtd">gun</a> or <a href="#gra">converter</a>.
<p>:<a name=db3><b>second natural glider</b></a> The glider produced at T=72 during the
<a href="#t2z">evolution</a> of a <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>. This is the common edge-shooting glider
output used in the <a href="#wyz">NW31</a> converter and several other converter
variants.
<p>:<a name=fnr><b>seed</b></a> A <a href="#th3">constellation</a> of still lifes and/or oscillators, which can
be converted into another Life object when it is struck by one or
more gliders. Usually the resulting object is a rare still life or
spaceship, more complex than the original constellation. <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>
single-glider (1G) seeds are more commonly seen than multi-glider
seeds, because a Spartan 1G seed can be readily constructed and
<a href="#idj">triggered</a> using a <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a>. See also <a href="#r77">freeze-dried</a>. For
example, the following is a 14<a href="#inz">sL</a> 1G seed for a <i>c</i>/7 loafer

<p>:<a name=mnb><b>Seeds of Destruction Game</b></a> An interactive search application written
by Paul Chapman in 2013. Its primary purpose was to assist in the
design of self-destruct circuits in self-constructing circuitry. It
has also regularly been helpful in completing glider syntheses, and
was used to find the <a href="#kwt">31c/240</a> base reaction for the <a href="#h6a">shield bug</a> and
<a href="#qyv">Centipede</a> spaceships.
<p>:<a name=vhj><b>self-constructing</b></a> A type of pattern, generally a <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a>,
that contains encoded construction information about itself, and
makes a complete copy of itself using those instructions. The
<a href="#vke">Gemini</a>, <a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a>, <a href="#yas">spiral growth</a> patterns, <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a>
and <a href="#gy6">Orthogonoid</a> are examples of self-constructing patterns.
Self-constructing spaceships often have trivially adjustable speeds.
In many cases, the direction of travel can also be altered, less
easily, by changing the encoded <a href="#eh7">construction recipe</a>. Compare
<a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a>, <a href="#abo">elementary</a>.
<p>:<a name=j6h><b>self-supporting</b></a> A type of pattern, specifically a <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a>,
that constructs <a href="#j4d">signals</a> or <a href="#dgl">tracks</a> or other scaffolding to assist
its movement, but does not contain complete information about its own
structure. Examples include the Caterpillar, <a href="#qyv">Centipede</a>,
<a href="#c85">half-baked knightship</a>, <a href="#jbk">waterbear</a>, and the <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillars</a>.
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> has been used as a general term for self-supporting
spaceships, but it is not very appropriate for the HBKs.
<p>In general a self-supporting pattern cannot be trivially adjusted
to alter its speed or direction. The variable speeds of the HBKs and
the Caterloopillars are exceptions, but their direction of travel is
fixed, and a specific Caterloopillar can't be made to change its
speed without completely rebuilding it. Compare <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a>,
<a href="#abo">elementary</a>.
<p>:<a name=tbp><b>semi-cenark</b></a> Either of two <a href="#ss2">semi-Snark</a> variants discovered by Tanner
Jacobi in November 2017. The name is due to the initial <a href="#gra">converter</a>,
which produces a <a href="#amn">century</a> output for every two input <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>. The
minimum safe repeat time is 43 ticks for the smaller initial
<a href="#k63">catalyst</a> shown in <a href="#s5f">CC semi-cenark</a> and <a href="#opz">CP semi-cenark</a>, or 42
ticks with the slightly larger catalyst variant shown below. There
is also <a href="#ds9">overclocking</a> possible at period 36, 38, or 39. The reset
glider can be followed immediately by a new trigger glider, as shown
below, so the minimum repeat time for an <a href="#pag">intermittent stream</a> of
gliders is only 50 ticks.

<p>:<a name=ss2><b>semi-Snark</b></a> Any small <a href="#qup">stable</a> <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#u15">conduit</a> that produces one
output glider for every two input gliders, with a 90 degree
reflection. These can act as period-doublers for any glider stream
whose period is at least equal to their repeat time, and so adding
one of these to a single glider <a href="#xtd">gun</a> often results in a pattern much
smaller than the older <a href="#m30">technology</a> of crossing the output of two
guns.
<p>The available semi-Snarks differ in their complexity, size, repeat
time, and the colour of their output gliders. The <a href="#h5l">CC semi-Snark</a>
was the first one found, and the term "semi-Snark" is often used
specifically for this object. The "CC" prefix stands for
<a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a>, by contrast with the more recently discovered
<a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a> <a href="#tg3">CP semi-Snark</a>.
<p>There are also CC and CP variants of a semi-Snark based on a

<p>:<a name=j4d><b>signal</b></a> Movement of information through the Life universe. Signals
can be carried by <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, <a href="#odj">fuses</a>, <a href="#v8p">drifters</a>, or <a href="#u15">conduits</a>.
Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the spaceship,
while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the
<a href="#ups">speed of light</a>.
<p>In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence of
a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> or other spaceship at a particular point at a particular
time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of gliders to
form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Signals can be
duplicated using <a href="#pzu">glider duplicators</a> or other <a href="#iwu">fanout</a> devices, and
can be used up by causing <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> on other parts of the Life
object.
<p>Signals are used in <a href="#j58">Herschel conduit</a> circuitry,
<a href="#eub">universal constructors</a>, <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>, and other computational
patterns such as the <a href="#sd7">pi calculator</a> and <a href="#sy8">Osqrtlogt</a> patterns.
<p>:<a name=s9v><b>signal elbow</b></a> A <a href="#u15">conduit</a> with <a href="#j4d">signal</a> output 90 degrees from its
input. This term is commonly used only for signal <a href="#wel">wires</a>,
particularly <a href="#aip">2c/3</a> signals. A <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> could reasonably be called a
"glider elbow", but <a href="#vwv">glider reflector</a> is the standard term. A
signal elbow with a <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> less than 20 ticks would enable a
trivial proof that Conway's Life is <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>.
<p>A near miss is the following elbow-like <a href="#gra">converter</a> found by Dean
Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2<i>c</i>/3 signal by 90 degrees, but
unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process.
This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended
(e.g., to make a closed loop).

<p>:<a name=x9k><b>single-arm</b></a> A type of <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> using just one
construction arm and <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> techniques to construct, usually,
<a href="#ret">Spartan</a> or near-Spartan circuitry. Compare <a href="#f8c">two-arm</a>.
<p>:<a name=way><b>single-channel</b></a> A type of <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> discovered and
developed by Simon Ekstr&ouml;m and others starting in December 2015. The
initial <a href="#f4l">elbow operation</a> toolkit was near-minimal, with just one
<a href="#gh5">push</a>, one <a href="#fye">pull</a>, and one output glider of each colour (see
<a href="#c9m">colour of a glider</a>). Later searches produced a much larger and
more efficient library.
<p>Single-channel <a href="#o36">recipes</a> consist of a <a href="#goz">stream</a> of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> on a
single <a href="#aii">lane</a> and aimed at a <a href="#igh">construction elbow</a>, usually separated
from each other by at least 90 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>. In spite of these strict
limitations, single-channel recipes can be made to do surprising
things. For example, it is possible to build a <a href="#wvr">Snark</a> directly on
the <a href="#mfc">construction lane</a> of an active construction arm, starting from
a single <a href="#g91">elbow</a> <a href="#dp5">block</a>. This can allow the arm to reach
efficiently around complex obstructions by bending itself through
multiple <a href="#og5">lossless elbows</a>. Known recipes can also remove an elbow
when it is no longer needed, by controlled demolition of the Snark.
<p>As of June 2018, almost all single-channel recipes are made up of
<a href="#ac3">singletons</a> and <a href="#ifg">synchronized</a> pairs of gliders, but no synchronized
triplets or larger groups. This is not an inherent limitation of
single-channel construction, but rather a limitation in the
<a href="#reu">search program</a> used to find currently known single-channel
<a href="#uxc">toolkits</a>.
<p>A useful byproduct of this limitation is that single-channel
recipes can be trivially adjusted to allow them to safely cross
perpendicular data streams, including other single-channel recipes
(or earlier parts of the same recipe). To avoid collisions with a
crossing stream, each singleton glider or glider pair can safely be
delayed by any even number of ticks, or technically by any multiple
of the period of the current <a href="#hyb">intermediate target</a>. The final result
of the construction will not be affected.

pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders
shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the
length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an
output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide

position of a <a href="#dp5">block</a>. The block can be moved by means of <a href="#p9q">glider</a>
collisions. See <a href="#smz">block pusher</a> for an example.
<p>In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the
existence of a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a> in Life) two gliders were used to
pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and
thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.

<p>Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to
pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push
it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to
be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It
suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway
did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as
Hickerson did).
<p>Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's
<a href="#qu4">URM</a>, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex
constructions, such as David Bell's <a href="#i3k">Collatz 5N+1 simulator</a> and Adam
P. Goucher's <a href="#sd7">pi calculator</a> and <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>
<a href="#d6c">universal computer</a>-constructor.
<p>:<a name=qvj><b>slmake</b></a> A <a href="#reu">search program</a> published by Adam P. Goucher in May 2017.
It accepts as input a <a href="#th3">constellation</a> of sufficiently widely
separated <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a>, and produces a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> <a href="#goz">stream</a> that will
perform a complete <a href="#qtm">slow glider construction</a> of that constellation,
starting from a single block.
<p>One of slmake's primary uses is to make <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a>
patterns much easier to design and build. It is capable of finding
<a href="#o36">recipes</a> not only for <a href="#ret">Spartan</a> <a href="#qup">stable</a> <a href="#tka">circuitry</a>, but also for
other useful non-Spartan circuits such as <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a>, <a href="#fzn">syringes</a>, and
<a href="#rhe">H-to-MWSS</a> <a href="#gra">converters</a>, provided that they are separated from other
nearby objects by a sufficient amount of empty space.
<p>:<a name=gpd><b>slow</b></a> See <a href="#qtm">slow glider construction</a>.
<p>:<a name=q0o><b>slow elbow</b></a> A movable <a href="#igh">construction elbow</a> that is controlled by a
<a href="#rti">slow salvo</a>, which most likely comes from a previous elbow in a
multi-elbow <a href="#bwp">construction arm</a>. Unlike a standard elbow which is
generally fixed on a single <a href="#mfc">construction lane</a> or at least within a
narrow range, a slow elbow can move freely in two dimensions as long
as there is room for it. Each slow elbow added to a construction arm
results in an exponential increase in the cost (in gliders) of the
final construction. Compare <a href="#og5">lossless elbow</a>.
<p>:<a name=qtm><b>slow glider construction</b></a> Construction an object by a "slow salvo" of
<a href="#p9q">gliders</a> all coming from the same direction, in such a way that
timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too
close behind one another. This type of construction requires an
initial seed object, such as a <a href="#dp5">block</a>, which is modified by each
glider in turn until the desired object is produced.
<p>In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a
block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53
gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of
<a href="#v06">sparse Life</a>, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the
first few generations collide with <a href="#eis">blonks</a> and other debris.
<p>Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for
<a href="#eub">universal constructors</a>. However, in this case the above definition
is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow
constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have
a particular timing modulo 2 (a "p2 slow salvo"). This gives much
greater flexibility, as <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a> can now be freely used in the
intermediate construction steps. The <a href="#iup">Snarkmaker</a> is a very large p2
slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following <a href="#tqi">edgy</a>
construction of an <a href="#uic">eater1</a> starting from a block.

<p>:<a name=u6m><b>smoking ship</b></a> A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> which produces <a href="#ogq">smoke</a>. If the smoke
extends past the edge of the rest of the spaceship, then it can be
used to perturb other objects as the spaceship passes by. Running
gliders into the smoke is often a good way to turn or duplicate them,
or convert them into other objects. Sometimes the smoke from a
smoking ship may itself be perturbed by accompanying spaceships in
order to form a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>. A simple example of a smoking ship is the

The stabilizers make the <a href="#sjt">domino</a> spark largely inaccessible, but the
snacker is <a href="#dwr">extensible</a>, as shown in the next diagram, and so a more

<p>:<a name=dnq><b>soup</b></a> A random initial pattern, either contained within a small area,
or alternatively filling the whole Life universe.
<p>Finite soups probably have behaviors very different than infinite
soups, but this is obviously unknown. Infinite soups may remain
chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound
to happen somewhere.
<p>Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on
that. See <a href="#v06">sparse Life</a> for a discussion of what can happen at a low
density.
<p>Finite soups for sizes such as 16&times;16 (asymmetric) have been
examined by the billions by scripts such as <a href="#uj4">apgsearch</a> to find
interesting results. Many new <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> and <a href="#or5">synthesis</a>
<a href="#o36">recipes</a> have been discovered, as well as previously known rare
patterns such as <a href="#tlb">stabilized switch engines</a>. In addition, soups are
used to generate statistical <a href="#y9n">census</a> data, and to decide whether
specific objects can be considered <a href="#tve">natural</a>.
<p>Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be <a href="#coi">symmetric</a>.
The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric

for new <a href="#abo">elementary</a> spaceships, and had considerable success. Other
people have continued these searches using tools such as <a href="#tm4">lifesrc</a>
and <a href="#ojz">gfind</a>, and as a result we now have a great variety of
elementary spaceships travelling at sixteen different velocities.
The following table details the discovery of elementary spaceships
with new velocities as of July 2018.

<p>Several infinite families of adjustable-velocity <a href="#u9w">macro-spaceships</a>
have also been constructed, of which the first was Gabriel Nivasch's
<a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> from December 2004. The macro-spaceship with the
widest range of possible speeds is Michael Simkin's <a href="#ni2">Caterloopillar</a>
from April 2016; in theory it supports any rational orthogonal speed
strictly less than <i>c</i>&lt;4. A somewhat similar design supporting any
rational speed strictly less than <i>c</i>/2 has been shown to be feasible,
but as of July 2018 no explicit examples have been constructed.
<p>A period <i>p</i> spaceship that displaces itself (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) during its period,
where <i>m</i>&gt;=<i>n</i>, is said to be of type (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i>. It was proved by Conway
in 1970 that <i>p</i>&gt;=2<i>m</i>+2<i>n</i>. (This follows immediately from the
easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate
greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)
<p>:<a name=e9z><b>Spaceships in Conway's Life</b></a> A series of articles posted by David Bell
to the newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata during the period
August-October 1992 that described many of the new <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> found
by himself, Dean Hickerson and Hartmut Holzwart. Bell produced an
addendum covering more recent developments in 1996.
<p>:<a name=rbf><b>spaghetti monster</b></a> The first <a href="#z0g">3c/7 spaceship</a>, found by Tim Coe in
June 2016. The spaceship travels orthogonally, has a minimum of 702
live cells and fits in a 27&times;137 bounding box.
<p>:<a name=eh8><b>spark</b></a> A pattern that dies. The term is typically used to describe a
collection of cells periodically thrown off by an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or
<a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>, but other dying patterns, particularly those consisting
or only one or two cells (such as produced by certain glider
collisions, for example), are also described as sparks. For examples
of small sparks see <a href="#o54">unix</a> and <a href="#u0y">HWSS</a>. Examples of much larger
sparks are seen in <a href="#npa">Schick engine</a> and <a href="#hvu">twin bees shuttle spark</a>.

<p>:<a name=uyk><b>sparker</b></a> An <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a> that produces <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>. These
can be used to <a href="#l7k">perturb</a> other patterns without being themselves

<p>:<a name=jhr><b>sparking eater</b></a> One of two <a href="#v1v">eaters</a> found in April 1997 and November
1998 by Dean Hickerson using his <a href="#hkm">dr</a> <a href="#reu">search program</a>, shown below
to the left and right respectively. These both absorb <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> as a
standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit <a href="#eh8">sparks</a>
at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders
with different phases as shown.

The above mechanisms can be used to build <a href="#vq5">intermitting glider guns</a>.
The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider
impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't
be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten
ticks after impact, which allows p4<i>N</i> guns to be used.
<p>The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform
other <a href="#eir">perturbations</a> "around the corner" of some objects. For
example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a
row of ten <a href="#gub">AK47 reactions</a> to form a much smaller period 94 glider
gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the
<a href="#hyq">AK94 gun</a>.)

<p>:<a name=v06><b>sparse Life</b></a> This refers to the study of the evolution of a Life
universe which starts off as a random <a href="#dnq">soup</a> of extremely low
density. Such a universe is dominated at an early stage by <a href="#dp5">blocks</a>
and <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a> (often referred to collectively as <a href="#eis">blonks</a>) in a
ratio of about 2:1. Much later it will be dominated by simple
<a href="#rku">infinite growth</a> patterns (presumably mostly <a href="#i53">switch engines</a>). The
long-term fate of a sparse Life universe is less certain. It may
possibly become dominated by self-reproducing patterns (see
<a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>), but it is not at all clear that there is
any mechanism for these to deal with all the junk produced by switch
engines.
<p>:<a name=ret><b>Spartan</b></a> A pattern composed of subunits that can be easily constructed
in any orientation, usually with a <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a>. Generally this means
that the pattern is a <a href="#th3">constellation</a> of Spartan still lifes:
<a href="#dp5">block</a>, <a href="#r3y">tub</a>, <a href="#i0n">boat</a>, <a href="#vx8">hive</a>, <a href="#ch9">ship</a>, <a href="#a3s">loaf</a>, <a href="#uic">eater1</a>, or <a href="#n2s">pond</a>.
Other small objects may sometimes be counted as Spartan, including
period-2 oscillators - mainly <a href="#i1p">blinkers</a>, but also <a href="#em5">beacons</a> or
<a href="#y3s">toads</a>, which may occur as <a href="#hyb">intermediate targets</a> in slow salvo
<a href="#o36">recipes</a>. Most <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> patterns are Spartan or mostly
Spartan, to simplify the process of self-construction.
<p>:<a name=q3b><b>speed booster</b></a> Any mechanism which allows a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> (indicated by the
presence or absence of a spaceship) to move faster than the spaceship
could travel through empty space. The original speed booster is

Here the top glider is boosted by passing through two
<a href="#lui">inline inverters</a>, emerging 5 cells further along than the unboosted
glider at the left.
<p>The fastest speed boosters are the <a href="#mzy">telegraph</a> and <a href="#shf">p1 telegraph</a>,
which can transfer a orthogonal signal at the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>,
although their bit rate is rather slow.
<p>Diagonal speed boosters have also been built using <a href="#nuk">2c/3 wires</a> or

<p>:<a name=yas><b>spiral growth</b></a> A <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> pattern built by Dave Greene in
August 2014 that uses four <a href="#eub">universal constructors</a> (UCs) arranged in
a diamond to build four more UCs in a slightly larger diamond. This
was the first B3/S23 pattern that exhibited spiral growth. Much
smaller versions have now been constructed using the <a href="#way">single-channel</a>
construction toolkit.
<p>:<a name=s1s><b>splitter</b></a> A <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#gra">converter</a> that accepts a single input signal
and produces two or more output signals, usually of the same type as
the input. An older term for this is <a href="#iwu">fanout</a>, or "fanout device".
<p>A sub-category is the <a href="#wzr">one-time</a> splitter, which is not technically
a converter because it can only be used once. One-time splitters are
usually small <a href="#th3">constellations</a> that produce two or more <a href="#nhx">clean</a>
gliders when struck by a single glider. In other words, they are
multi-glider <a href="#fnr">seeds</a>. These are important for constructing
self-destruct circuitry in <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> spaceships.
<p>The following combination, a <a href="#fzn">syringe</a> attached to an SE7T14
<a href="#gra">converter</a> combined with an <a href="#wyz">NW31</a> converter, is one of the smallest

<p>:<a name=qup><b>stable</b></a> A pattern is said to be stable if it is a <a href="#pve">parent</a> of itself.
Stable objects are oscillators with period 1 (p1), and are generally
called <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a>.
<p>:<a name=r66><b>stable pseudo-Heisenburp</b></a> A multi-stage <a href="#gra">converter</a> constructed by
Dave Greene in January 2007, using a complex recipe found by Noam
Elkies to insert a signal into a <a href="#nuk">2c/3 wire</a>. The wire's high
transmission speed allows a <a href="#j4d">signal</a> from a <a href="#m17">highway robber</a> to catch
up to a <a href="#i1v">salvo</a> of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a>. Ultimately the mechanism restores the
key glider, which was destroyed by the highway robber in the first
stage of the converter, to its exact original position in the salvo.
<p>Much smaller stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices have since been
designed that use simple 0-degree glider <a href="#fnr">seed</a> <a href="#th3">constellations</a>
instead of a 2<i>c</i>/3 wire.
<p>These patterns are labeled "pseudo-Heisenburp", because a true
<a href="#ozg">Heisenburp device</a> does not even temporarily damage or affect a
passing glider, yet can still produce an output <a href="#j4d">signal</a> in response.
However, it is impossible to construct a <a href="#qup">stable</a> device that can
accomplish this for gliders. True stable Heisenburp devices are
possible with many other types of <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a>, but not with gliders
which have no usable side <a href="#eh8">sparks</a> to initiate an output signal.
<p>:<a name=u1r><b>staged recovery</b></a> A type of signal-processing <a href="#tka">circuit</a> where the
initial reaction between <a href="#k63">catalysts</a> an incoming signal results in an
imperfect recovery. A catalyst is damaged, destroyed completely as
in a <a href="#i1x">bait</a> reaction, or one or more objects are left behind that
must be cleaned up before the circuit can be reused. In any of these
three cases, output signals from the circuit must be used to complete
the cleanup. In theory the cleanup process might itself be <a href="#yx7">dirty</a>,
requiring additional cleanup stages. In rare cases this might
theoretically allow the construction of special-purpose circuits with
a lower <a href="#nc2">recovery time</a> than would otherwise be possible, but in
practice this kind of situation does not commonly arise.
<p>An example is the record-breaking (at the time) 487-tick reflector
constructed by Adam P. Goucher on 12 April 2009. 487 ticks was a
slight improvement over the repeat time of the <a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a>.
The reflector featured a standard <a href="#ogp">Callahan G-to-H</a>, with cleanup by
an internal <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> glider reflector found by Dieter Leithner many
years before. This in turn was cleaned up by the usual ungainly
Herschel plumbing attached to the G-to-H's output. The dirty glider
reflector is not actually fully recovered before a second p487 signal
enters the full reflector. However, it has been repaired by the time
the internal reflector is actually needed again, so the cycle can be
successfully repeated at p487 instead of p497.

<p>:<a name=vf6><b>stator</b></a> The cells of an <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> that are always on. Compare
<a href="#mfj">rotor</a>. (The stator is sometimes taken to include also some of
those cells which are always off.) The stator is divided into the
<a href="#b95">bushing</a> and the <a href="#io3">casing</a>.
<p>By analogy, the cells of an <a href="#v1v">eater</a> that remain on even when the
eater is eating are considered to constitute the stator of the eater.
This is not always well-defined, because an eater can have more than
one eating action.
<p>:<a name=mif><b>statorless</b></a> A statorless <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> is one in which no cell is
permanently on - that is, the <a href="#vf6">stator</a> is empty, or in other words
the oscillator has the maximum possible volatility. See the
<a href="#sqn">volatility</a> entry for examples of this type of oscillator at
different periods. Statorless oscillators can be constructed for any
sufficiently large period, using <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a> technology.

<p>:<a name=gt3><b>still life</b></a> Any <a href="#qup">stable</a> pattern, usually assumed to be finite and
nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this
definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair
of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be
an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.
<p>For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a
stable pattern as a <a href="#rxv">strict still life</a> only if its <a href="#yrz">islands</a> cannot
be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in
their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can
be referred to as a <a href="#th3">constellation</a>. If its cells form a single
<a href="#tsb">cluster</a> it is also, more specifically, either a <a href="#sma">pseudo still life</a>
or a <a href="#epc">quasi still life</a>.
<p>In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be
divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into
two. See the 32-bit <a href="#f6b">triple pseudo</a> (32 bits) and the 34-bit
<a href="#a9e">quad pseudo</a> for examples.
<p>All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be
<a href="#ciy">glider constructible</a>. It is an open question whether all still
lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For
a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially
useful in <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a> circuitry, see also <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>.
<p>The smallest still life is the <a href="#dp5">block</a>. Arbitrarily large still
lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a <a href="#paf">canoe</a> or
<a href="#lq1">barge</a>. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can
be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of <a href="#wss">zebra stripes</a> or
<a href="#ymr">chicken wire</a>, among many other options. See <a href="#b8s">density</a> for more
precise limits.

<p>The <a href="#j46">catch and throw</a> <a href="#m30">technology</a> in a <a href="#dns">Caterpillar</a> is a somewhat

neither of the <a href="#r8q">tables</a> are stable by themselves. See also
<a href="#f6b">triple pseudo</a>, <a href="#a9e">quad pseudo</a>.
<p>Still lifes have been enumerated by Conway (4-7 bits), Robert

<p>:<a name=kij><b>superlinear growth</b></a> Growth faster than any rate proportional to T,
where T is the number of ticks that a pattern has been run. This
term usually applies to a pattern's population growth, rather than
diametric growth or bounding-box growth. For example, <a href="#q4w">breeders</a>'
and <a href="#yq2">spacefillers</a>' population asymptotically grows faster than any
linear-growth pattern. It may also be used to describe the rate of
increase in the number of subpatterns present in a pattern, such as
when describing a <a href="#dzz">replicator</a>'s rate of reproduction. Due to limits
enforced by the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>, no pattern's population can grow at
an asymptotic rate faster than <a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a>. See
<a href="#ovj">switch-engine ping-pong</a> for the lowest-population superlinear
growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the
record-holders.
<p>:<a name=rft><b>superstring</b></a> An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one
side so that it moves at the <a href="#ups">speed of light</a>, often leaving debris
behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald
and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by
Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many
different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen
Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)
<p>Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run
between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a <a href="#odj">fuse</a> which can be
made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony
Smithurst and uses <a href="#r3y">tubs</a>. (This is shown below. The superstring
itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one
blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the
track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be
used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this
example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track
consisting of <a href="#i0n">boats</a>. At present these are the only two waveguides
known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It
would be interesting to find one that remains intact.
<p>See <a href="#s35">titanic toroidal traveler</a> for another example of a
superstring.

<p>The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance
<a href="#fzn">syringe</a> variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not
technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
source can deliver the signal to the block <a href="#wle">factory</a> (the two
<a href="#uic">eater1s</a> on the right side of the pattern). Alternate <a href="#gra">converter</a>
mechanisms could also be used to place the block.
<p>An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism,
also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 <a href="#k3a">H-to-G</a>. See
also <a href="#f3j">bistable switch</a> for a very robust and versatile toggle switch
with two input <a href="#aii">lanes</a> and four possible outputs.
<p>:<a name=bh0><b>switchable gun</b></a> A <a href="#xtd">gun</a> that includes a mechanism to turn the output
stream off and on with simple signals, often gliders. A small
example is Dieter Leithner's switchable LWSS gun from July 8, 1995.
The ON signal enters from the northeast, and the OFF signal from the
northwest:

<p>:<a name=i53><b>switch engine</b></a> The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman
in 1971, which is a <a href="#u97">glide symmetric</a> unstable <a href="#u5t">puffer</a> which moves
diagonally at a speed of <i>c</i>/12 (8 cells every 96 generations).
<pre>

</pre>
<p>The <a href="#csj">exhaust</a> is <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> and unfortunately catches up and destroys
the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found
several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce <a href="#u5t">puffers</a>,
using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See
<a href="#tlb">stabilized switch engine</a> and <a href="#faq">ark</a>.
<p>No <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> were able to be made from switch engines until Dean
Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see <a href="#we6">Cordership</a>).
Switch engine <a href="#m30">technology</a> is now well-advanced, producing many <i>c</i>/12
diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.
<p>Small <a href="#ml6">polyominoes</a> exist whose <a href="#t2z">evolution</a> results in a switch
engine. See <a href="#z1l">nonomino switch engine predecessor</a>.
<p>Several three-glider collisions produce <a href="#yx7">dirty</a> reactions that
produce a stabilized switch engine along with other <a href="#fdc">ash</a>, making
<a href="#rku">infinite growth</a>. Until recently the only known syntheses for
<a href="#nhx">clean</a> unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There
are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider
arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to,
making it easier to repeat the reaction:

David Bell used this in June 2005 to construct a "bobsled"
oscillator, in which a switch engine <a href="#wle">factory</a> sends switch engines
down a channel, at the other end of which they are deleted.

<p>:<a name=ovj><b>switch-engine ping-pong</b></a> A very large (210515&times;183739)
<a href="#l9c">quadratic growth</a> pattern found by Michael Simkin in October 2014.
Currently this is the smallest starting population (23 cells) known
to result in a quadratic population growth rate. Previous
record-holders include <a href="#mwj">Jaws</a>, <a href="#fpy">mosquito1</a>, <a href="#fpz">mosquito2</a>, <a href="#fq0">mosquito3</a>,
<a href="#fq1">mosquito4</a>, <a href="#fq2">mosquito5</a>, <a href="#b33">teeth</a>, <a href="#h14">catacryst</a>, <a href="#xrn">metacatacryst</a>,
<a href="#y9d">Gotts dots</a>, <a href="#n2g">wedge</a>, <a href="#bpz">26-cell quadratic growth</a>,
<a href="#xu6">25-cell quadratic growth</a>, and <a href="#dqz">24-cell quadratic growth</a>.
<p>:<a name=coi><b>symmetric</b></a> Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis
and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as
the <a href="#dp5">block</a>, <a href="#ktx">beehive</a>, <a href="#n2s">pond</a>, <a href="#a3s">loaf</a>, <a href="#kfr">clock</a>, and <a href="#i1p">blinker</a> are
symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are <a href="#jif">Kok's galaxy</a>,
<a href="#sjg">Achim's p16</a>, <a href="#r0a">cross</a>, <a href="#obt">Eureka</a>, and the <a href="#sj5">pulsar</a>.
<p>Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple
copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless
the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered
trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two <a href="#gr9">LWSSs</a>
travelling together a hundred cells apart).
<p>There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an
object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of
cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or
rows, and can have a <a href="#dz9">gutter</a>. Even symmetry occurs when the line of
reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects
with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.
<p>Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all
symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their <a href="#t2z">evolution</a>.
Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve,
but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single
object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two
gliders interact to form a <a href="#yw9">blockade</a>:
<pre>
	..O.........
	O.O.........
	.OO........O
	.........OO.
	..........OO
</pre>
<p>Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This
commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to
change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing
of new cells at their <a href="#dz9">gutter</a> interface. Examples of this are
<a href="#k14">twin bees shuttle</a>, <a href="#tih">centinal</a>, and the object shown in <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>.
Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric
object using nearby <a href="#nm7">oscillators</a> or <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> in a symmetric
manner. Examples of this are <a href="#npa">Schick engine</a>, <a href="#sav">blinker ship</a>, and
<a href="#uml">hivenudger</a>.
<p>Many <a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> found by <a href="#reu">search programs</a> are symmetric because
the search space for such objects is much smaller than for
non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include <a href="#c3c">dart</a>, <a href="#s22">60P5H2V0</a>, and
<a href="#gbh">119P4H1V0</a>.
<p>:<a name=ifg><b>synchronized</b></a> Indicates that precise relative timing is required for
two or more input <a href="#j4d">signals</a> entering a <a href="#tka">circuit</a>, or two or more sets
of <a href="#p9q">gliders</a> participating in a <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>. Compare

2015, accepting a glider as input and producing an output <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
As of June 2018 it is the smallest known converter of this type, so
it is very often used to handle input gliders in complex <a href="#j4d">signal</a>
<a href="#tka">circuitry</a>, as described in <a href="#iod">Herschel circuit</a>. A second glider can
safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but <a href="#ds9">overclocking</a>
also allows the syringe to work at a <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a> of 74 or 75 ticks.
If followed by a <a href="#dt1">dependent conduit</a> a simple <a href="#uid">eater2</a> can be used
instead of the large <a href="#s6n">welded</a> <a href="#k63">catalyst</a> shown here. A

<p>The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old

<p>:<b>TOLLCASS</b> Acronym for <a href="#ij6">The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search</a>.
<p>:<a name=uxc><b>toolkit</b></a> A set of Life reactions and mechanisms that can be used to
solve any problem in a specific pre-defined class of problems:
<a href="#p9q">glider</a> timing adjustment, <a href="#i1v">salvo</a> creation, <a href="#fnr">seed</a> construction,
etc. See also <a href="#ijt">universal toolkit</a>, <a href="#m30">technology</a>.
<p>:<a name=lu8><b>torus</b></a> As applies to Life, usually means a finite Life universe which
takes the form of an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i> rectangle with the bottom edge considered
to be joined to the top edge and the left edge joined to the right
edge, so that the universe is topologically a torus. There are also
other less obvious ways of obtaining a toroidal universe.
<p>See also <a href="#abn">Klein bottle</a>. Every object in a torus universe
obviously either dies or becomes a <a href="#gt3">still life</a> or <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a>.
<p>:<a name=lu2><b>total aperiodic</b></a> Any finite pattern which evolves in such a way that
no cell in the Life plane is eventually periodic. The first example
was found by Bill Gosper in November 1997. A few days later he found
the following much smaller example consisting of three copies of a
p12 <a href="#cn0">backrake</a> by Dave Buckingham.

<p>:<a name=o6q><b>transparent</b></a> In signal circuitry, a term used for a <a href="#k63">catalyst</a> that is
completely destroyed by the passing signal, then rebuilt. Often
(though not always) the active reaction passes directly through the
area occupied by the transparent catalyst, then rebuilds the catalyst
behind itself, as in the <a href="#ffu">transparent block reaction</a>. See also
<a href="#qgn">transparent lane</a>.
<p>:<a name=ffu><b>transparent block reaction</b></a> A certain reaction between a block and a
<a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> <a href="#mgk">predecessor</a> in which the block reappears in its original
place some time later, the reaction having effectively passed through
it. This reaction was found by Dave Buckingham in 1988. It has been
used in some <a href="#j58">Herschel conduits</a>, and in the <a href="#bqa">gunstars</a>. Because the
reaction involves a Herschel predecessor rather than an actual
Herschel, the following diagram shows instead a <a href="#saf">B-heptomino</a> (which
by itself would evolve into a block and a Herschel).

<p>:<a name=ra8><b>transparent debris effect</b></a> A mechanism where a <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a> or other
active reaction completely destroys a <a href="#k63">catalyst</a> in a particular
location in a <a href="#u15">conduit</a>. After passing through or past that
location, the same reaction then recreates the catalyst in exactly
its original position. This type of catalysis is surprisingly common
in <a href="#j4d">signal</a> <a href="#tka">circuitry</a>. For an example, see
<a href="#ffu">transparent block reaction</a>.
<p>The transparent object is most often a very common <a href="#gt3">still life</a>
such as a block or beehive. Rarer objects are not unknown; for
example, a transparent <a href="#a3s">loaf</a> was found by Stephen Silver in October
1997, in a very useful <a href="#rb6">elementary conduit</a> making up part of a
<a href="#wii">Herschel receiver</a>. However, not surprisingly, rarer objects are
much less likely to reappear in exactly the correct location and
orientation, so transparent reactions involving them are much more
difficult to find, on average.
<p>:<a name=qgn><b>transparent lane</b></a> A path through a signal-producing <a href="#tka">circuit</a> that can
be used to merge signal streams. The signal is usually a
<a href="#xo4">standard spaceship</a> such as a <a href="#p9q">glider</a>. It can either be produced
by the circuit, or it can come from elsewhere, passing safely through
on the same <a href="#aii">lane</a> without interacting with the circuit. A good
example is the NW31 converter, which has two glider outputs on
transparent lanes:

<p>"Trigger" is also used when a spaceship reacts with another object
to cause a reaction to occur whenever desired (but perhaps only at
particular intervals). The object being triggered lies <a href="#h45">dormant</a>
until the reaction is required. All <a href="#z8l">turners</a> and <a href="#r77">freeze-dried</a>
constellations are triggerable.
<p>In some cases the object is not destroyed so that the reaction can
be repeated after some <a href="#lhp">repeat time</a>. See for example <a href="#gra">converter</a>
and <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>, and more specifically <a href="#slp">MWSS out of the blue</a> and

<p>:<a name=xdg><b>trivial</b></a> A trivial period-<i>N</i> oscillator is one in which every cell
oscillates at some smaller factor of <i>N</i>. See <a href="#nze">omniperiodic</a>. For
example, the joining of a period 3 and a period 4 <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a> as

However, there are trivial oscillators that meet this requirement,
but may still be considered to be <a href="#u4d">non-trivial</a> because the
different-period <a href="#mfj">rotors</a> are not separated by <a href="#vf6">stator</a> cells. An
example is Dean Hickerson's <a href="#jlc">trivial p6</a>. Conversely, there are
oscillators formed by trivial combinations of high-period <a href="#xtd">guns</a> or
<a href="#uyk">sparkers</a> that are only technically non-trivial, because the
lower-period components overlap but do not interact in any way.
<p>"Trivial" is also used to describe a <a href="#pve">parent</a> of an object which
has groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result,
such as isolated faraway cells. For example, here is a trivial
parent of a block.

<p>:<b>trombone slide</b> An arrangement of four 90-degree <a href="#vj8">reflectors</a> that can
be placed into the path of a <a href="#p9q">glider</a> so as to delay it by an
adjustable number of generations, without changing its <a href="#aii">lane</a>. More
generally, any combination of <a href="#tka">circuits</a> may be referred to as a
trombone slide, if the grouping can be moved as a single unit that
functions as a 180-degree glider <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>.
<p>The smallest known trombone slides are made using <a href="#wvr">Snarks</a>. In the
trombone slide shown below, sample input and output gliders are
shown. The input glider will reach the same output location 128
generations sooner if the trombone slide is removed.
<p>If the top and left Snarks are moved together diagonally to the
upper left by <i>N</i> cells, then the glider delay is increased by 8<i>N</i>
generations since the glider has to travel <i>N</i> more cells in each
direction. This sliding action gives the trombone slide its name.
If only the final Snark is moved, then the output glider's path can
be altered by a number of full diagonals.

<p>Trombone slides made of the same type of component cannot alter the
glider path by half-diagonals, and can only change the timing by
multiples of 8 generations. For other timing changes, different
components are necessary. These may be stable like the
<a href="#vxg">Silver reflector</a> or the <a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a> example shown in the
<a href="#vj8">reflector</a> article, or periodic like the various <a href="#onm">bumpers</a>.
<p>:<a name=w43><b>true</b></a> Opposite of <a href="#rqv">pseudo</a>. A <a href="#xtd">gun</a> emitting a period <i>n</i> stream of
<a href="#iz5">spaceships</a> (or <a href="#fnm">rakes</a>) is said to be a true period <i>n</i> gun if its
mechanism oscillates with period <i>n</i>. The same distinction between
true and pseudo also exists for <a href="#u5t">puffers</a>. An easy way to check that
a gun is true period <i>n</i> is to stop the output with an <a href="#v1v">eater</a>, and
check that the result is a period-<i>n</i> <a href="#nm7">oscillator</a>.
<p>True period <i>n</i> guns are known to exist for all periods greater than
61 (see <a href="#cg9">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>), but only a
few smaller periods have been achieved, namely 20, 22, 24, 30, 36,
40, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, and 54 through 61. See also <a href="#wls">Quetzal</a> for

<p>Of the reactions on the first row, the glider output is the same
<a href="#u3g">parity</a> for all but the long boat. The three still lifes are all
<a href="#cbi">colour-changing</a>, but the <a href="#y3s">toad</a> happens to be a <a href="#wrz">colour-preserving</a>
turner. The third row shows an <a href="#rs7">aircraft carrier</a> serving as a
"0-degree turner" that is also colour-changing.
<p>Three of the simplest 180-degree turners are shown in the second
row. The <a href="#qo7">Blockic</a> 180-degree turner is colour-preserving. The
<a href="#hzp">long boat</a> and <a href="#cgb">long ship</a> are again colour-changing; this is
somewhat counterintuitive as the output glider is on exactly the same
<a href="#aii">lane</a> as the input glider, but gliders travelling in opposite
directions on the same lane always have opposite colours.
<p>Many small one-time turner <a href="#th3">constellations</a> have also been
catalogued. The 90-degree two-block turner on the right, directly
below the toad, is also colour-changing but has the opposite parity.
<p>A one-time turner reaction can be used as part of a glider
<a href="#aob">injection</a> mechanism, or as a switching mechanism for a <a href="#j4d">signal</a>.
If a previous reaction has created the sacrificial object, then a
later glider is turned onto a new path. Otherwise it passes through
the area unaffected. This is one way to create simple switching
systems or logic <a href="#tka">circuits</a>. An example is shown in <a href="#z1n">demultiplexer</a>.

There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown

the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method

<p><a name=U>:</a><b>UC</b> = <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<a name=jco><b>underpopulation</b></a> Death of a cell caused by it having fewer than two
<a href="#t75">neighbours</a>. See also <a href="#wol">overpopulation</a>.
<p>:<a name=ih8><b>unit cell</b></a> = <a href="#rx7">unit Life cell</a>.
<p>:<a name=rx7><b>unit Life cell</b></a> A rectangular pattern, of size greater than 1&times;1, that
can simulate Life in the following sense. The pattern by itself
represents a dead Life cell, and some other pattern represents a live
Life cell. When the plane is tiled by these two patterns (which then
represent the state of a whole Life universe) they evolve, after a
fixed amount of time, into another tiling of the plane by the same
two patterns which correctly represents the Life generation following
the one they initially represented.
<p>It is usual to use the prefix "meta-" for simulated Life features,
so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell (constructed by
David Bell in January 1996), one metatick is 5760 <a href="#fyw">ticks</a>, and one
<a href="#xis">metacell</a> is 500&times;500 cells. Capital letters were originally used to
make this distinction - e.g., Generation, Cell - but this usage is no
longer common.
<p>In December 2005, Jason Summers constructed an analogous unit cell
for Wolfram's Rule 110, a one-dimensional <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> that
is known be universal. See also <a href="#bsm">OTCA metapixel</a>, <a href="#t7o">p1 megacell</a>.
<p>:<a name=mk4><b>universal</b></a> See <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a>, <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>,
<a href="#ijt">universal toolkit</a>.
<p>:<a name=d6c><b>universal computer</b></a> A computer that can compute anything that is
computable. (The concept of computability can be defined in terms of
Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number of
other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent
definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill Gosper
and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to construct a
universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove the universality
of a <a href="#u7f">cellular automaton</a> with simple rules was in fact Conway's aim
in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof is outlined in
<a href="#uik">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="#xcz">The Recursive Universe</a>.
<p>Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in
practice In April 2000, Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine
construction (see <a href="http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm">http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm</a> for details).
This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of
a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.
But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction of a
universal computer, see
<a href="http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/">http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/</a>. This is a universal
register machine based around Dean Hickerson's
<a href="#nb4">sliding block memory</a>.
<p>In 2009 Adam P. Goucher constructed a programmable <a href="#ret">Spartan</a>
universal computer/constructor pattern using stable <a href="#e7u">Herschel</a>
circuitry. It included memory tapes and registers capable of holding
a simple universal instruction set and program data, and also a
minimal <a href="#x9k">single-arm</a> universal constructor. Its size meant that it
was extremely impractical to program it to be <a href="#vhj">self-constructing</a>,
though this was theoretically possible if the escape of large numbers
of gliders could be allowed as a side effect.
<p>In February 2010, Paul Rendell completed a universal Turing machine
design with an unlimited tape, as described in his thesis at
<a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf">http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf</a>.
<p>In 2016 Nicolas Loizeau ("Coban") completed a Life pattern
emulating a complete 8-bit programmable computer.
<p>See also <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<a name=eub><b>universal constructor</b></a> A pattern that is capable of constructing
almost any pattern that has a <a href="#p4s">glider synthesis</a>. This definition is
a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it is not
known, for example, whether all <a href="#gt3">still lifes</a> are constructible. In
any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct
itself in order to qualify as such.
<p>An outline of Conway's proof that such a pattern exists can be
found in <a href="#uik">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="#xcz">The Recursive Universe</a>. The
key mechanism for the production of gliders with any given path and
timing is known as side-tracking, and is based on the
<a href="#ozb">kickback reaction</a>. A universal constructor designed in this way
can also function as a universal destructor: it can delete almost
any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.
<p>In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype
programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct
objects by means of <a href="#qtm">slow glider constructions</a>. It likely that it
could be programmed to construct itself, but the necessary program
would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would be needed
in order to copy the program.
<p>A universal constructor is theoretically most useful when attached
to a <a href="#d6c">universal computer</a>, which can be programmed to control the
constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what
follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes
this computer.
<p>The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of
theoretical consequences.
<p>For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of
itself. This is a <a href="#dzz">replicator</a>.
<p>The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy of
itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself. This
would be a (very large, very high period) <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. Any
translation is possible, so that the spaceship could travel in any
direction. If the constructor makes a rotated but unreflected copy
of itself, the result would be a looping spaceship or
<a href="#ljz">reflectorless rotating oscillator</a>.
<p>The constructor could also travel slower than any given speed,
since we could program it to perform some time-wasting task (such as
repeatedly constructing and deleting a block) before copying itself.
Of course, we could also choose for it to leave some debris behind,
thus making a <a href="#u5t">puffer</a>.
<p>It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal
constructor implies the existence of a <a href="#qup">stable</a> <a href="#vj8">reflector</a>. This
proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance
now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.
<p>Progressively smaller universal-constructor mechanisms without an
attached universal computer have been used in the
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a>, <a href="#yas">spiral growth</a> pattern, and the <a href="#knq">Demonoids</a> and
<a href="#gy6">Orthogonoid</a>. See also <a href="#way">single-channel</a>.
<p>Another strange consequence of the existence of universal
constructors was pointed out by Adam P. Goucher and Tanner Jacobi in
2015. Any glider-constructible pattern, no matter how large, can be
constructed with a fixed number of gliders, by working out a
construction recipe for a universal constructor attached to a decoder
that measures the distance to a faraway object. The object's
position encodes a numeric value that can be processed to retrieve as
many bits of information as are needed to build a <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a> to
construct any given target pattern. The simplest design, requiring
less than a hundred gliders, is described in <a href="#sh6">reverse caber tosser</a>.
<p>:<b>universal destructor</b> See <a href="#eub">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<b>universal register machine</b> = <a href="#qu4">URM</a>
<p>:<a name=ama><b>universal regulator</b></a> A <a href="#dkj">regulator</a> in which the incoming gliders are
aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject to
some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the
previous glider).
<p>Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March
2003. It is adjustable, so that the output can be aligned to any
desired period. A <a href="#qup">stable</a> universal regulator was constructed by
Dave Greene in September 2015, with a minimum delay between test
signals of 1177 ticks. Later stable versions have reduced the delay
to 952 ticks.
<p>A universal regulator can allow two complex <a href="#tka">circuits</a> to interact
safely, even if they have different base <a href="#ve5">periods</a>. For example,
signals from a <a href="#qup">stable</a> logic circuit could be processed by a
period-30 mechanism, though the precise timing of those signals would
change in most cases.
<p>:<a name=ijt><b>universal toolkit</b></a> A set of Life reactions and mechanisms that can be
used to construct any object that can be constructed by glider
collisions. Different universal toolkits were used to construct the
<a href="#d9l">linear propagator</a>, <a href="#yis">10hd Demonoid</a>, <a href="#nxn">0hd Demonoid</a>, and
<a href="#gy6">Orthogonoid</a>, for example.
<p>:<a name=hfc><b>universe</b></a> The topology of the cells in the Life grid. In the normal
universe (the usual <a href="#mj0">Life</a> arena), the grid is infinite in both
directions. In a cylindrical universe, the grid is finite in one
direction, and the cells at the two edges are adjacent to each other.
In a <a href="#lu8">torus</a> universe, the grid is finite in both directions, and the
cells at the top and bottom edges are adjacent, and the cells at the
left and right edges are adjacent. There are several other more
obscure types of universe.
<p>Objects found in the cylindrical and toroidal universes can also
run in the normal universe if an infinite number of copies are
arranged to support each other. Sometimes the objects can be
supported in other ways to make a useful finite object. This is one
reason that <a href="#dnq">soup</a> searches are run in alternative universes, to find
such objects.

<p>The smallest period for which the existence of such statorless
oscillators is undecided is 7. There are oscillators with volatility
arbitrarily close to 1 for all but finitely many periods, because of

<p>:<a name=jbk><b>waterbear</b></a> ((23,5)<i>c</i>/79 obliquely, p158) A <a href="#j6h">self-supporting</a> oblique
<a href="#u9w">macro-spaceship</a> constructed by Brett Berger on December 28, 2014.
It is currently the fastest oblique macro-spaceship in Conway's Game
of Life by several orders of magnitude, and is also the smallest
known oblique macro-spaceship in terms of bounding box, superseding
the <a href="#bf1">Parallel HBK</a>. It is no longer the smallest or fastest oblique
spaceship due to the discovery in 2018 of the <a href="#abo">elementary</a>
<a href="#nl7">knightship</a> <a href="#c8a">Sir Robin</a>.
<p>Previous oblique spaceships, the <a href="#vke">Gemini</a> and the
<a href="#c85">half-baked knightships</a>, are stationary throughout almost all of
their life cycles, as they construct the necessary mechanisms to
support a sudden short move. The waterbear constructs support for
<a href="#ekr">reburnable fuse</a> reactions involving <a href="#vdb">(23,5)c/79 Herschel climbers</a>
that are in constant motion.
<p>:<a name=p5v><b>wave</b></a> A wick-like structure attached at both ends to moving
spaceship-like patterns, in such a way that the entire pattern is
mobile. Especially if the wave gets longer over time, the supporting
patterns are <a href="#wsu">wavestretchers</a>.
<p>Also, the gliders or spaceships emitted by a rake may be referred
to as a wave, again because the line as a whole appears to move in a
different direction from the individual components, due to the rake's
movement. Compare with <a href="#goz">stream</a>.
<p>In general a wave can be interpreted as moving at a variety of
different velocities, depending on which specific subcomponents are
chosen as the starting and ending points for calculating speed and
direction. See <a href="#vsn">antstretcher</a>, <a href="#wsu">wavestretcher</a> for a practical
example of identical wave ends being connected to spaceships with
different velocities.

wavestretcher spaceship.
<p>Connecting the following to a standard diagonal <a href="#vsn">antstretcher</a>

and also an alternate <a href="#rgm">space nonfiller</a> mechanism.

A required supporting <i>c</i>/5 <a href="#eh8">spark</a> is shown at the right edge. It can
be supplied by a <a href="#cmu">spider</a> or another <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal spaceship with a
similar <a href="#pyw">edge spark</a>. Alternatively, the <i>c</i>/5 component could
theoretically be replaced by a supporting spaceship travelling

<p>:<a name=wtj><b>weekender distaff</b></a> (2<i>c</i>/7, p16982) The first orthogonal 2<i>c</i>/7 rake,
constructed by Ivan Fomichev on May 22nd, 2014. It uses the weak
<a href="#eh8">sparks</a> from <a href="#dxb">weekenders</a> to perturb an LWSS into an active reaction
in a variable-period loop, which produces a series of <a href="#rti">slow salvo</a>

<p>:<a name=vac><b>wick</b></a> A stable or oscillating linearly repeating pattern that can be
made to <a href="#cb2">burn</a> at one end. See <a href="#odj">fuse</a>. Wicks are often fairly
dense, with repeating units directly connected or at least adjacent
to each other, as in the beehive <a href="#lip">lightspeed wire</a> for example.
However, sparse wicks such as the blocks in the
<a href="#pk9">31c/240 Herschel-pair climber</a> are known, and arbitrarily sparse
wicks can be constructed.
<p>:<a name=b97><b>wickstretcher</b></a> A <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>-like object which stretches a <a href="#vac">wick</a> that
is fixed at the other end. The wick here is assumed to be in some
sense connected, otherwise most <a href="#u5t">puffers</a> would qualify as
wickstretchers. The first example of a wickstretcher was found in
October 1992 (front end by Hartmut Holzwart and back end by Dean
Hickerson) and stretches <a href="#fhv">ants</a> at a speed of <i>c</i>/4. This is shown
below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following

<p>Diagonally moving <i>c</i>/4 and <i>c</i>/12 wickstretchers have also been built:
see <a href="#rwj">tubstretcher</a> and <a href="#mgw">linestretcher</a>. In July 2000 Jason Summers
constructed a <i>c</i>/2 wickstretcher, stretching a p50 <a href="#z87">traffic jam</a> wick,
based on an earlier (October 1994) pattern by Hickerson. A <i>c</i>/5
diagonal wickstretcher was found in January 2011 by Matthias
Merzenich, who also discovered a <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal wickstretcher two

<p>:<a name=jw0><b>wicktrailer</b></a> Any <a href="#dwr">extensible</a> <a href="#ib1">tagalong</a> or <a href="#psq">component</a> that can be
attached to itself, as well as to the back of a <a href="#iz5">spaceship</a>. The
number of generations that it takes for the component to occur again
in the same place is often called the period of the wicktrailer.
This has little relation to the period of the component. See
<a href="#ff3">branching spaceship</a> for an example of a wicktrailer that is part of
a p2 spaceship, but repeats itself in the same location at period 20.
